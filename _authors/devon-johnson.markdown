Devon has loved magazines ever since she could read. She has lived in Dubai, London, and Santa Barbara, experiences which have provided her with an insatiable taste for travel. She has been published in her college literary journal, the Phoenix, and is currently writing a fiction novel. She loves working with authors and creatives on their processes from start to finish. She is also a self-proclaimed coffee addict (3 cups today, and counting).
