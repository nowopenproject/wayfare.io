Good news bot makers! You can now send typing activity to the Web Messenger to make your bot a bit more alive! To learn more about typing activity, visit the [documentation](http://docs.smooch.io/rest/#typing-activity).

## Fixes and improvements
- We fixed a regression that appeared with the quick replies where the messenger would empty all the messages and add them back (which caused a flickering on the first appUser message).
- Viber information will now render correctly and will leverage the deep link on mobile.
