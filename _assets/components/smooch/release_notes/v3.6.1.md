# What's new ?
- Babel peer dependency is now more lenient and will accept newer versions.
- Local storage fallback logic was fixed to use in-memory storage when local storage isn't present in the browser.
- `document.hasFocus` isn't supported in every browser and we added a small fix to make it not fail when it's the case.
