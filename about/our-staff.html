<h2>Our Staff</h2>

<h3>Our Founders</h3>

<h4>Brandon Arbini</h4>
<p>CEO</p>
<p>Chief Americano Drinker</p>
<p>On the weekend you can catch Brandon: swimming with his three kids,  jamming on the guitar while his son plays the drums, and wrapping up the day reading by the fire pit. Top that off with a family adventure or a date with his wife, and he’s a happy man. It also helps if he has an ice cold Americano from Neat Coffee or a LaCroix in his hand at all times. The flavor?  Pamplemousse of course!</p>
<p>Be sure to ask Brandon about: his childhood lemonade stand that got shut down by the city, the time he jumped off a cliff in Hawaii, how he won over his wife with crispy m&amp;m’s and orange juice, or the time he lived in the Santa Cruz mountains where he had to protect his home from an aggressive wild turkey. </p>

<h4>Jeff Tanner</h4>

<p>Chief Cartographer</p>
<p>On the weekend you can catch Jeff: Saying good morning to the morning (along with every tree, flower, bird, and bug) in backyard walks with his daughters and pups, catching up on premier league football (aka soccer), or perfecting his grilling skills. </p>
<p>Be sure to ask Jeff about: Wabi-sabi, the time he almost died in Thailand, how he saved lives by singing a popular television jingle to a bear, or the time he collected dozens of Christmas trees to build the most epic of winter forts.</p>
