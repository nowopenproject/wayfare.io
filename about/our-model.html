<p><em>Wayfare has helped me to come alive in my work. I came from working alone in a windowless office to a place where there is life happening to the fullest. I no longer leave my day exhausted and drained, but with new ideas, new questions, and a new sense of energy to take me into the next day. I feel more like the person I was created to be working at Wayfare.</em> </p>

<h3>Startup Incubator</h3>
<p>Programs that help birth and incubate creation restoring movements that advance the common good. </p>

<h5>Testimonial(s):</h5>
<p>"Wayfare Labs gave me a sacred space to process not only my role in the Yellow Co., but my current steps in life. Coming in questioning a lot of the bigger questions about God, work, and relationships, Labs and its team gave me a safe place to feel and to heal, and to eventually rise above some pretty strenuous circumstances. Our business and team has developed exponentially because of [Wayfare Labs], and my personal life has flourished because of the freedom they gave to express life concerns. Our work and life can't always be separated, especially when it involves our creative selves. I was so impacted by the environment they created to celebrate the victories and mourn the losses with those that had grown to be a family I deeply, deeply love." - Sally Rae Kim, The Yellow Co.</p>

<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Gathering people around celebration, learning, creativity, and a passion for social good. </p>

<h5>Testimonial(s):</h5>
<p>"As a small non-profit social enterprise, it can be extremely hard to find a venue that is beautiful and works with our needs. When I came across Wayfare I immediately knew that it was the right place for us. They worked with us the whole time leading up to the event and helped us create an environment that reflected the heart of our organization. Most workplaces and event venues don't participate that much; but that is not the case with Wayfare. Their emphasis on community development and support was in line with our mission. They were not only passionate about helping us throw a great fundraiser, but they were genuinely concerned in helping further our cause of rehabilitation and empowerment for those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. It was a perfect relationship of collaboration, as well as an incredible venue for our event. I would work with them again in a heart beat and you should too!" - Hughie Hughes, President of Povertees</p>
