## Our Values

What motivates your work? For us (and chances are, for you too), it’s not just the work itself. We love what we do, but we believe it’s the values behind our work that matter most. Our values serve to guide the work we do, give meaning and purpose to our days, and keep us accountable to contribute to the good of our community.

### Live Adventurously

Life isn’t easy, but we embrace the challenge. We believe the journey matters as much as the destination. We seek change and growth, show up to the hard stuff, and take chances for the sake of the common good.

### Empower Others

We strive to encourage and support and know those around us. We journey together and stand alongside one another in success and failure. We’re all in this together and want the best for each other.

### Pursue Growth & Learning

We're on a continuous journey.  We seek ways to grow our skills and character (even when it’s uncomfortable) so we can, in turn, do more for others.

### Create Beauty

We take time to notice and celebrate the good and the beautiful around us, and we’re moved to create more of it.

### Restore the Broken

We are not paralyzed by the brokenness in our communities, cities, and world. We seek big and small opportunities to serve and stand with those who are suffering and those who are in the trenches. We value the unique and important role we all play in improving our broken world and work together to restore it.

### Rest and Celebrate

We can’t produce good work if work is all we do. We make space to step back from the task list, have fun, and celebrate our achievements and the achievements of others. We also make time for cornhole and ice cream when possible (it’s always possible).

### Be Generous

We joyfully share of our time, skills, and resources; and over-deliver as much and as often as we can. We’re committed to giving the best of who we are and what we have.
