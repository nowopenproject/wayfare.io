      <p class="card-text">In the middle of the hot summer of 2016 in a garage in Fullerton, CA, a few friends got together and dreamed. It may be cliché, but they wanted to create the best business they could imagine: an excellent brand with a pure heart. They wanted to do something truly good and make the world brighter. <br />
They talked and bonded and rallied around certain indispensable values. We brainstormed 50 possible names and wrote them on a whiteboard. We lived on iced coffee from Starbucks and Del Taco burritos (and they still have hundreds of hot sauce packets).</p>

      <p class="card-text">When I was engaged, I once had a woman tell me that I would never understand what being a mom meant until I birthed my own child. That I would never understand the true depths of the heart of a mother, the very heartbeat of motherhood, until my body carried, delivered, and nursed a baby of my very flesh-made in love and intention.<br />
<br />
I didn’t know how to respond. I had just lost two precious children as a foster mom. They were my biological half brothers and my foster sons at the same time, and they were reunified with our birth mom, a devastating decision by the Orange County Juvenile Courts, for me and for them.</p>

      <p class="card-text">“My story has been one marked by journey. Journey through a sea of unknowns, intricate passions, and deep questions. I’ve always been fascinated by people, and I’ve always loved business. Since I was little, I’ve always sought to get understanding at the root, and to be apart of people’s journeys.”<br />
<br />
Within minutes of my conversation with Kalee, I recognize an immense amount of experience, depth, and passion. After graduating from Southern Methodist University as a communications and PR major, Kalee dove right into a career in marketing at a sports entertainment firm. With clients like Puma, ATNT, and other big name companies, Kalee was balancing a lot of responsibility, traveling constantly, and often working 60-80 hour weeks. <br />
“When you’re working that much and you’re traveling that much, it can also be really lonely and isolating. So I came to this place… if I’m going to be working this much, I should at least be doing something I really care about.”</p>

      <p class="card-text">What do you think of when the word marriage comes up? Long flowing white dress? Small house in the suburbs? Two individuals who are devoted to spending the rest of their lives together? <br />
<br />
When Casey and Meygan met each other in college, it was love at first sight. Young and in love, they decided to get married just two years later. The young couple went into their new stage of life full of wonder and love.<br />
<br />
While marriage is a beautiful union, it is not at all what the movies depict it to be. Between both sets of parents, there were 12 marriages. They knew firsthand the troubles, the pain, and the brokenness of marriage. Refusing to let those failed marriages affect their future, Casey and Meygan dove into their marriage headfirst to prove to themselves that marriage can work.<br />
<br />
That idealized view came crashing down soon enough as their lives became plagued with arguments after arguments. Wasn’t marriage the answer to happiness? Why was it suddenly so difficult to maintain happiness after they said “I do”? They vowed that divorce was not an option, but things seemed so bleak and the first three years of the marriage progressively became worse and worse. They were missing connection.<br />
<br />
But this is not where their story ends. Casey and Meygan knew it was time for a change. But what would help rekindle their marriage? They surrounded themselves with mentors that guided them through this difficult season. They sought to improve and work on themselves before finding fault in the other. They read any book they could get their hands on and attended a marriage boot camp! In many ways, they started dating each other again, discovering what made the other person tick, learning how to communicate better, taking up hobbies together, to back when they were two wide eyed college lovers. They were committed to connecting again.<br />
<br />
Through commitment and connecting, they learned that great marriages don’t just happen by accident. It takes a lot of work, intentionality 365 days a year; thus Marriage365 was born! Casey and Meygan are continually striving to help keep marriages thriving to help out similarly struggling couples, whether that’s through their monthly podcast, online courses, or even being coaches and mentors. They want to see marriages last a lifetime and be a part of the solution. Too often marriage counseling hovers on two extremes; focusing on only family and not the underlying problems or too individualistic, often resulting in divorce. Marriage365 uniquely places itself in the middle, getting down to the raw issues while focusing and family and love.<br />
<br />
Their advice for struggling couples? “Many married couples do not want to spend time or money on their marriage until it’s too late. They don’t see the value of regular maintenance with their relationship. The biggest advice we would give is that money, careers, your home, your car all can come and go but your relationships with others is where you’ll find true happiness and contentment. It’s truly how you should measure your success in life.”<br />
<br />
This mission is not an easy one; each couple is unique and success looks different for each one.  No one should have to deal with life’s hardships alone and this organization has so many resources that can aid your journey with your spouse. Visit marriage365.org for marriage resources, to refer your friends, and donate. Commit to connecting again with helpful resources, including online courses, private coaching, monthly webcasts, and e-books like one of their most popular: “Naked Dinners”.</p>

      <p class="card-text">When I was in 2nd grade I was tested and diagnosed with dyslexia. For many months I felt like I couldn’t keep up with the rest of my class, and finally my parents had some answers. Because of this, I qualified for the RSP program at my school and three times a week I had to leave my regular class to do my school work in another room with a Special Ed aid. As a seven year old, I didn’t fully understand why I was being asked to work differently, but it definitely made me feel isolated. I learned very early on how to joke with my friends at school and be self deprecating about my situation.</p>

I couldn’t find the “key” that came with the doorknobs which is the tool that I usually use for the job. Without the right tool, I tried to improvise with a bobby pin. Then I tried a screwdriver. I ended up attempting to take the doorknob apart and find a way to unlock the door. It still didn’t unlock. I ended up putting the doorknob back together with the screwdriver and decided to keep looking for the right tool. My son finally remembered where he saw it last. Once I had the right tool, I unlocked the door on my first attempt and it took me 2 seconds. However, I had spent 30 minutes prior to that trying to do it without the tool. I left me frustrated in the moment and finally relieved when I had the right tool for the job.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title"><a href="/stories/2016/05/27/4-ways-you-can-help-foster-children-today/">4 Ways You Can Help Foster Children Today</a></h3>
      <p class="card-text">When we hear the terms foster care or foster child, there’s a varied amount of emotions that can pop up-compassion, helplessness, sadness, empathy, even anger…there’s something about the picture we have in our mind when we think foster child that evoke this feeling of sadness in us-maybe we imagine torn shoes and dirty hair-because, as humans we recognize that children were never meant to experience things like homelessness, abuse, or neglect. It does something to our gut and, out of a feeling of total loss as to what to do, we turn our eyes and hands towards something a little more… ”manageable.”<br />
<br />
When I think foster care, or foster children, the words that come to my mind are reality, family, and home.<br />
<br />
I became a foster parent in 2012 to my three brothers, ages 2, 7, and 12 when I was 22. I was single, had dreams of going overseas to help people (ironic?) and wasn’t even sure if I wanted to have kids of my own one day. I hadn’t lived with my biological family in over six years, and had been unofficially adopted by an amazing family, so I wasn’t aware how bad the situation had gotten with my bio-mom and three younger half brothers (you can read more of my story from last year’s post with Wayfare here). After two years of taking care of them, two of the three boys were reunified, and after nearly two years of no contact with them, we received a call to come to Orangewood Children’s Center and pick up our two little “lost boys” as we learned to call them. They had been put back in the system.<br />
<br />
Now, we are a family of seven (in those two years, I got married, pregnant, had a baby, adopted a teen and got pregnant again…yep, we’ve been busy).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What I come across most in my conversations about foster care is the lack of want to get involved, not because of a lack of care, but just the fact that it’s, for lack of better words, messy. So, so, messy. The system is messy. Trauma is messy. All of it is really, really messy and, if you’re not empowered and educated, the orphan crisis our country, state, even county is facing, can feel debilitating. How the heck am I supposed to help these kids when it’s too painful to even swallow?<br />
<br />
I want to challenge you, this foster care awareness month, to not focus on the 3,000 kids in Orange County without a home, but to focus on the 1 you can help. In my experience being a foster parent, here are four ways I believe you can make an impact, some big, some small, but all necessary.<br />
<br />
####Become a CASA<br />
<br />
Become a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) is a volunteer appointed by judges to watch over over and advocate for abused and neglected children, to make sure they don’t get lost in the legal and social services system. CASAs stay with their assigned child until their case is closed, so there is a two year commitment, and not only mentor the youth, but get to represent the foster youth’s wants and needs in court. We love CASA, and have first hand seen it work for one of our adopted kids, but, unfortunately, there is such a large amount of kids in the system, and such a low amount of CASAs, our two other boys are on a waiting list. We need more CASAs (specifically, dudes) to step up! Commitment level: Medium (two year involvement, once a month mentoring, once a month court).<br />
<br />
####Donate to Advokids<br />
Advokids is an amazing non-profit organization founded in 1993 by an attorney and child psychologist working with children entering foster care, who saw a need for better implementation of the system’s resources for the children. They believe (and, hopefully so do  you!) that every foster child in California has the right to safety, security, and a permanent home. They offer free legal aide and counsel for foster parents and foster youth, and really fight for permanency in terms of placement for the children. Sometimes, unfortunately, the kids are the ones who get lost in between all the laws, and legal rights of the birth parents, and are often displaced…Advokids and the lawyers behind it do everything in their power to educate the need for permanent housing for children’s physiological development. They are an organization that has fought for our kids in unique ways. Since they are a non-profit, they run off donations. Consider talking to your employer to match your donation or giving this month for foster care awareness month. Their website is full of information on the foster care system, juvenile court system, and child psychology as pertains to foster children if you’re looking for more general information. Commitment level: zero. Give when/how you want, and educate yourself.<br />
<br />
####Donate Goods or Gift Cards<br />
Like…. good goods. When children are brought into Orangewood Children’s Home, they often come with the clothes on their back. It’s a 24 hour emergency shelter for children that can’t be immediately placed with a family member of foster care placement, and they don’t stay for more than 72 hours. Once children are picked up, they are given a bag of some pants, underwear, and shoes. When we received the call to pick up the boys from Orangewood, they had been there since 3am, and because of all the paperwork, house checks, and fingerprinting we had to go through to pick up our boys, we didn’t get to take them home until 8pm. When we went through the bag of clothes the boys had received, nothing was new… even the underwear was used. Thankfully, we have a strong community that was ready to help at the drop of a hat, so we were able to kindly reject the items. But my heart breaks for the children and emergency placements that don’t have access to this kind of quick help. Remember this when going through your old clothes and donation pile: these kids are precious, and deserve the best you can give. Would you let your son or daughter wear someone’s used underwear, even if it was washed? Would you let your son or daughter wear stained or ripped shirts to school? These kids aren’t ungrateful, they will take whatever you give, but they are still kids, and more than that, humans who deserve the dignity of clean clothes. Here’s a wishlist by Orangewood Children’s Home for reference. If you know a foster parent, consider giving them a gift card to Marshall’s, TJ Maxx, or Ross (places where you can get name brand clothes at a decent bargain) or Target because…Target is everything, people.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
####ASK, and expect nothing in return <br />
If you know a foster parent, foster youth, or former foster youth, don’t assume you know what they need. Ask. Ask questions like, “What would be helpful?” “What do the kids like to do?” We had a friend pay for our youngest guy to play soccer-his first time ever playing team sports. It was an amazing experience for not just him to get connected to a team, but for us to bond as his primary support and family. This time around, I’ve learned to let people give and not give into the pressure to give back in return, but the first time around, some donors put this unspoken pressure that they would receive something from us in return…It wasn’t fair and it put a ton of pressure on not just me, but on the kids to be at different dinners throughout the week to thank people. Give without the expectation of receiving anything in return, not even a thank you. Foster parents are busy and these kids are precious with unique circumstances. It’s your job to respect that.<br />
<br />
The foster care system can seem overwhelming, and it’s tempting to look away out of helplessness. Many people tell me that they can never be a foster parent…but you don’t have to be a foster parent to help a foster child! There are big and small ways to make an impact on a child’s life. These are our kids, Orange County. We hold a unique responsibility to embrace them and empower the foster parents who have stepped in around them to give them the best childhood possible, considering the circumstances.</p>
