        <h2 class="m-b-2">4 Reasons Why We're Excited to Share Our New Website</h2>

<p>After a two month labor of love, we couldn’t be more excited to share the new Wayfare website with you today. Here are four reasons why…</p>

<h3 id="it-represents-two-years-of-growth---and-our-community-today">1. It represents two years of growth - and our community today</h3>

<p>Wayfare launched two years ago with an idea, a logo, a website with rates, an email address, and 5 wonderful coworking members (that are still with us today… shout out to the original 5! Love you all). What we lacked in space, furniture, members, and coworking expertise, we made up for in tireless drive, countless brainstorm meetings, lean flexibility, a readiness to fail and try again, and a steadfast vision for what Wayfare would be.
 
In the early days, we used to dream of a space filled with people committed to using their unique gifts to advance <a href="/about/common-good">the common good</a>. We envisioned a space that went far beyond desks to park your laptop, but one that awakened people to their true calling and restored the culture of work. We dreamed of a community that would value and support one another, would be eager to work and partner together for the common good… and ultimately, a community that would give birth to new dreams and movements that drive social change.</p>

<p>We’ve had the joy of seeing these visions for Wayfare not only come to life but become the daily norm in this space. On any weekday at Wayfare, you’ll encounter people collaborating and ideating over coffee, writing, pitching new startups in our <a href="/startups">startup programs</a>, mentoring, working on <a href="http://blog.wayfare.io/2016/07/11/member-monday-emily-mclaughlin/">alleviating poverty in Africa</a>,  <a href="http://www.cappital.co">building apps</a>, <a href="http://www.softboot.org">creating engineering jobs for emancipated youth</a>, designing, <a href="http://blog.wayfare.io/2016/04/25/member-monday-bailey-van-tassel-of-abel-impact/">helping companies develop powerful giving strategies</a>, coaching, and eating ice cream over a game of cornhole.</p>

<p>We are inspired every day by this <a href="/about">community</a>, the work created here, and the common thread of shared values for a better world- but our website didn’t have the same affect. Somewhere in the midst of two years of growth, building products and systems, refining Wayfare’s business model, serving our members, and consuming copious amounts of coffee, <strong>our website and branding took the back seat</strong>. As our staff and membership has grown, it has become a top priority for us to create a new website that represents the dynamic, dimensional identity of <a href="/about">our community</a> today.</p>

<h3 id="it-shows-how-were-unique">2. It shows how we’re unique</h3>

<p>Don’t get us wrong here. We love coworking, workshops, gatherings, and startups… but it’s the common mission and thread that binds them all together that really drives what we do. We’re not just in this for the ergonomic chairs or the leftover eucalyptus garlands… we’re in this to advance <a href="/about/common-good">the common good</a>, to make the world a better place, to empower others, and to pursue the world’s best future… together. We’re excited to share this mission with you- and invite you to be a part of it.</p>

<p>While the design aspect of the  website was important, the  website rebrand was less centered on the aesthetics as it was about communicating Wayfare’s unique mission and <a href="/about/values">community values</a>. We put pen to paper, defined and refined who we are, and invited our members, friends, and clients to be a part of it… because they truly are the reason this community is what it is today. We’re excited for you to <a href="/about/our-model">read what they had to say</a>.</p>

<h3 id="its-visual-and-fun-like-our-community">3. It’s visual and fun (like our community)</h3>

<p>Design is such a key element in making a brand’s identity and energy come to life, and we’re excited for a new website and branding that portrays the inviting, adventurous, and communal spirit that embodies <a href="/about">the Wayfare community</a>.</p>

<p>While a rebrand entails much more than slapping on a new logo, we decided it was a great place to start. Our first logo was great for the initial season, and we’re excited to carry forward it’s clean minimalism and the accelerating lines that depict “wayfaring” or journeying. The new logo represents this same adventurous spirit, with added warmth and fluidity.</p>

<p>Beyond the logo, we weaved this same sentiment throughout all the other design aspects of the new  website. We did this in a few ways: incorporating more color and adding a new color palette, becoming more visual in our storytelling, incorporating the adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit of the Wayfare community through adventure themed icons, and adding more white space to let our products speak for themselves. </p>

<h3 id="it-shows-where-were-going-and-were-going-places">4. It shows where we’re going… and we’re going places</h3>

<p>One of the main drivers of our website overhaul was the rapid growth of the Wayfare coworking community. In two short years we’ve grown from 6 to 102 coworking members and our private offices are filled with small organizations that have become family (and there’s a waiting list)! We’ve hosted over one hundred gatherings from workshops to fundraiser dinners, birthed eight startups (and are launching four more in December), and have grown from a staff of three  to eleven. Our <a href="/locations/costa-mesa">HQ space</a> is nearly at capacity and we not only needed a more robust website to handle the growth, but <strong>we needed to expand</strong>.  </p>

<p>We’ve never been the type to shy away from a challenge and are always seeking ways to serve and empower more people, so we started brainstorming expansion. For us, expansion is not (and will never be) about fame or fortune. While we will always strive for global impact, expansion is not about beating competitors, having a distinguished world-class name, or swimming in profit. It’s always been about the common good. It’s about creating the most good for all people, empowering hungry leaders, giving birth to creation restoring movements, providing safe places for community to flourish, helping people walk into their true calling, and about building a world where the most vulnerable thrive.</p>

<p><strong>We thoughtfully decided that the best way to achieve our mission and maximum impact was to launch a <a href="/membership">new membership model</a> and expand to more <a href="/locations">locations</a></strong>. This was a straightforward yet powerful next step for growth, a timely response to current demand, and a solution that is already proven in the marketplace. Our <a href="/membership">new membership</a> now allows us to be more inclusive of our global market, provide practical and relational resources for those who don’t necessarily need workspace, and provide more flexibility (and locations) for those that do. To support this growth, we needed a website and platform that could handle multiple locations and streamline our services, as well as make the critical shift from a local coworking space to a global community that enables us to welcome more world changers.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy the new site &amp; that it inspires and drives you towards a life of greater impact. <a href="/membership">Looking for community</a>? <a href="/locations">Need a workspace</a>? <a href="/startups">Have an idea you’d like to turn into reality</a>? We’d love to learn more about you, and we openly welcome any website <a href="https://wayfare.typeform.com/to/vn3h2H">feedback and suggestions</a>!</p>
