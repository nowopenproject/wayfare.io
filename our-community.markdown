Wayfare is a community of individuals who are driven by an aspiration to advance good in the world. We're on the same journey, but taking different paths.

We work as software engineers, designers, and photographers. We’re writers, pastors, and accountants. We’re program managers, app developers, and non-profit founders. We work in marketing, business, technology, and churches.

But it isn’t as much about what we do as it is about who we are.

We are builders, innovators, and culture shakers. We are creators, dreamers, and difference-makers. We are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, neighbors and friends. We are believers in the beauty of work and we’re committed to lives of impact. We are advancers of the common good.

If you’re reading this and resonating with it, this community includes you. And we’re glad you found us.
