However in recent years, the overall busyness, increased demands of the season, and the general state of the world, had taken away from much of the joy for me. It was for these and a variety of other reasons, (not the least of which was a gift request for squeaking dolphin slippers), that my husband and I made some changes that have shaped how we celebrate Christmas with our kids and it has made a positive difference in how we experience this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We live in a world where so many people are in need and experiencing horrible circumstances. It can be tempting to call it quits on the celebrating while others the world are suffering. Alternatively, it is tempting to carry on with our lives willfully ignoring the sadness because it can all seem like just too much. However, as with most things in this world, there is a simultaneous tension of celebrating the good while acknowledging the broken and taking steps to help change it. In an ever evolving effort of trial and error, my husband and I have tried to strike a balance between the two and develop a new way of operating in this tension, especially this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Why Do We Celebrate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your cultural, religious, and familial traditions, the reasons behind your celebrations will vary. However, regardless of what holiday or holidays you find yourself celebrating this time of year, the answer to why can help inform how you celebrate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our family celebrates Christmas. The celebration of the birth of Christ and/or Santa Claus or some version of him are the two main focuses of Christmas in the US and many parts of the world.  As my husband and I considered the why of Christmas and gift giving, we came up with an explanation that both allowed for the celebration of the holiday and all of its traditions and also made room for simpler more generous practices. We decided that our family’s “why” was to honor Christ’s birth by following his example. We decided that giving gifts to others and caring for people in need is an expression of love for others and our love for God, which Jesus famously said are the greatest commands. We also acknowledge that St. Nicholas was a generous man who gave to those in need and Jesus himself said that serving the most needy in his name, was like serving him. We have found that this is a good balance between our personal faith and the fun that Santa Claus brings while still giving meaning to the gifts and hopefully inspiring generosity in our kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will obviously look different for each family, but most holiday traditions this time of year include some form of gratitude, honor of others, and outward expression of love and care. Identifying why we celebrated was a key part in putting and keeping the focus on where we wanted it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A Family Decision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After explaining to our kids the reasons behind our traditions, we invited them into the decision making process. We told them that we had a budget for Christmas and asked them how they would feel about us spending less money on their gifts, and instead directing a portion of our budget to help others in need. Since this was a pretty significant change from how they were accustomed to celebrating, they had some questions as to what they would look like, but ultimately were in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Four Gifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a guideline for a simpler and less frantic gift extravaganza than in years past, we decided on quality over quantity. I found an idea on the internet to help guide us in our gift giving to our kids.  The idea is a fun rhyme that includes 4 categories: something you want, something you need, something to wear, and something to read.(Pro tip: If you can make things rhyme, kids get instantly excited.) So our kids each get 4 presents from us; 1 in each category. They also get stockings and Santa usually drops off a family gift in the form of an experience or activity that can be enjoyed together. In all honesty, I think our kids enjoy Christmas morning more now than they did before we started the 4 gifts. They savor each gift and seem to use and enjoy what they receive more than in years past. They have also become increasingly excited to make gifts and give to others with their own skills, time, and money. (Bonus: Knowing they get 4 gifts in specific categories helps decrease the asks for things like bacon scented body wash).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Caring for Those in Need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Christmas morning, before we do anything else, we start off the day talking about the meaning of Christmas and we let the kids each choose what they want to give to someone in need by choosing from a give back gift catalog. The first Christmas we did this, I thought that they’d want to rush through this process to move on to their stockings and presents, but they surprised us and took great care in what they selected. Each year we love seeing a glimpse of their hearts and interests through what they pick and the reason behind it. A few catalogs we like are:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.compassion.com/charitable-gift-catalog.htm&quot;&gt;Compassion International&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://preemptivelove.nationbuilder.com/ann&quot;&gt;Preemptive Love Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://donate.worldvision.org/ways-to-give/gift-catalog&quot;&gt;World Vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been giving four gifts and selecting from the giving catalogs for a few years now and it makes the day so much more enjoyable. The kids know to savor each gift the receive, they know what to expect, and they really genuinely get excited about the opportunity to pick something to give to someone in need. Christmas miracles still happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Presence vs. Presents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve scaled back on the amount of gifts we purchase, it has freed up time and space to focus on experiences unique to this time of year. Looking back on my lasting childhood memories, I don’t remember many of the gifts I received, but I vividly remember the traditions we had. Playing in the snow with my siblings, baking cookies, decorating the tree, the candlelight Christmas Eve service at our church followed by a “sleepover” with my sister in my room are among my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve reflected on these experiences from my childhood, I’m passing some on to my kids, and we’re starting traditions of our own as well. Some years we are able to and want to do more than others. This year, as the kids are getting older, our school and activity schedules have been more full than in years past, so in our tiny moments of downtime, we have all needed more space to rest and just be together. With a simpler approach to the holidays, it has been really wonderful to not feel the need to fill every free moment in an effort to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world full of chaos, my continuous hope is that we all can experience peace in our homes, that it will bring hope to our hearts, and will compel our actions toward love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="Christmas" /><category term="giving" /><category term="family" /><category term="presents" /><category term="give back" /><summary type="html">As a child Christmas was my favorite holiday.

Now, let’s look at what it means to be a creator. I propose three components.
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creators are rooted in their identity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creators display artistry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creators make meaning for others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creators are rooted in identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creators have deep self awareness; they know their unique strengths, skills, and abilities. They are in tune with who they were created to be, and are ever-vigilant about working harmoniously with themselves. They don’t attempt to align with the outside voices of expectation or obligation, but they do include others in the wonder of discovering their best contribution to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity is never found in individualism, isolation, and self-centeredness. It is always found in relationship. And it is a never ending journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, the question I believe we need to constantly ask ourselves is this: What is my best contribution to the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know the answer, don’t worry. You’re not alone. There’s no expectation, only invitation. And to redeem work, we must ask it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creators display artistry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artistry is celebrating and creating beauty, and not just visually, but in all realms. You can be an artist in designing handbags or in designing organizations or in the simple way you clean a room. Artistry is not limited to the “creative class.” In fact, if you’re glazing over as you read this section, please don’t. Don’t let “creatives” exclude your unique identity from this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And creatives, you can help others recognize the ways in which they are artists in the seemingly mundane endeavors of everyday life. There’s plenty of room for the celebration of what is beautiful and the creation of new beauty in our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question I believe we need to constantly ask is this: What beauty am I being called to celebrate or create today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creators make meaning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we all get this. We all want a sense of purpose in our lives, but for me, making meaning is for others. Our meaning is rooted in our identity, but this is different. This is about seeing the best in others and helping them find their meaning.
This is an other-orientation that fights against the self-centeredness we see at the root of all other human entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus told us to love our neighbors as ourselves. I believe love for ourselves is first and foremost embracing our identity, and loving others is to make meaning for them and help them live into their identity and artistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question I believe we need to constantly ask is this: How am I, right here, right now, making meaning for others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends, I believe we’re in one of the most profound cultural shifts in the history of the world. We’ve moved from being hunter/gatherers to an agrarian economy to the industrial revolution to the information age, and we’re on the cusp of what some are calling the innovation economy. But while I think that term is true for much of the world, it doesn’t capture the fullest extent of our creative calling because it is mostly transactional when it should be wholly transformational. I believe if you’re reading this, you are likely a participant in the creation economy. The creation economy is a subversive economy that’s fighting against toil and entropy that are too normal in our world. It is countercultural and calls for more. It demands whole life pursuit of our identity, artistry, and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is my invitation to you today: Enter into a conversation with us at Wayfare about what it means to be people of the creation economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People of the creation economy refuse to engage around anything other than creation or re-creation. They refuse to contribute to the political diatribes or useless arguments about who won debates. They refuse to scroll mindlessly through Facebook or Instagram feeds. They refuse to toil through the next Netflix series that they just have to watch. Instead, they focus on restoring what is broken and celebrating and creating beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People of the creation economy realize that the problem of work is actually a problem of toil. The problem isn’t that we work too much. On the contrary, it’s that we toil too much on distractions and work too little on creation. The problem is that we are consumed by transacting work rather than transforming work as an act of creation or re-creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acts of creation or re-creation could be as complex as building a multinational NGO to fight extreme poverty around the world or as simple as picking up your kids’ toys at the end of the day–or sometimes over and over, all day –as an act of re-creation because it is part of the fight against the entropy introduced with self-centeredness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you join me in constantly asking these questions of yourself and others? &lt;strong&gt;What is my best contribution to the world? What beauty am I being called to celebrate and create? And what meaning can I make as an act of love for others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creation work, which is rooted in identity, displaying artistry, and making meaning for others is the future past of work. It was always the intention. And it can be true of us again. Let’s redeem work. Let’s be people of the creation economy, and let’s create the world’s best future together.&lt;/p&gt;

It just feels like they’re trying to make a calm holiday all jumpy and excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s our sensitive one. He often hears things differently than they are intended, is easily discouraged and offended, and takes about nine hours to tell us any kind of story. I laughed it off and turned up Baby It’s Cold Outside, which was sandwiched between Frosty the Snowman and Holly Jolly Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s something true about our boy’s observation. There is this tendency to skip the dark and jump straight to the lights, the coco, the loud and bright and happy…forgetting that the silent night was what started it all-the calm, bright, quiet evening that preludes all the celebrations begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, the truth is, the tension that exists between the quiet and the dark and the loud and the light is thick and hard to sit in. But, this thick tension is exactly where we are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s cliche to say that this is a hurting world in need of healing hands, I know. But it is a statement that renders truth…We live in a time of uncertainty and fear, where people are lacking security in their lives. I can’t go one day without hearing a story of a woman losing a baby after trying to get pregnant for years, or someone losing their job right before Christmas, or someone shaken by some inconceivable act of violence. This is the reality of our world right now. People we know, people we work with and family members and those we love, and those we don’t, are hurting, right now. So how can you respond?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t soften the blow. You can’t clean their pain away like food on a dirty dish. But you can be there for them. Even if you don’t know how, even if you don’t have the perfect words to say, here are a few ways to sit in the dark and calm of the night someone you encounter may be facing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don’t offer a solution.&lt;/strong&gt; 
Seriously, don’t. Just accept what’s happening with them. Look them in the eyes and listen…listen hard. Nod and grimace and swallow and smile and accept them in whatever stage of grief they are at. Don’t correct. Don’t judge. Set your biases aside and open your ears. Your job is not to solve, correct, or inform. Your job is to be a rock for them to hear their own voice bounce off of. Let their experience matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Pay for a housecleaner.&lt;/strong&gt; 
When we got our emergency foster placement, someone paid for us to have a housecleaner for nearly five months. I’m a firm believer that if the home is chaotic and messy and cluttered as heck, the mind and heart will reflect the same. Someone in grieving needs open space to breathe. They need permission to focus only on the ones in their care, and to be respectful of this very moment in their lives. The house won’t be perfect. Dishes will still fill the sink….but to know that the bathrooms are clean this week, that the stove is free of gunk and that the floors have been vacuumed could be the absolute greatest gift you give someone this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Drop off a meal, a book, and a candle (or coffee).&lt;/strong&gt;
When I was going through an intense season of grief after losing our foster sons, not having to think about cooking was such a gift. People would bring us cupcakes, dinner, a latte…anything they thought could bring me a smile, and would sit on my couch and listen or do my dishes and not require a thing from me. Think of what brings you comfort on a rainy day (Gilmore Girls marathon?)…it will probably bring your friend some cheer, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Do be the pursuer and let them be messy.&lt;/strong&gt; 
I lost a lot of relationships in my season of grief. I felt like I had enough energy to love my husband and my kids, and there were friends that didn’t understand that I couldn’t be the pursuer anymore. I had to let those friendships go so I could focus inward. When I did that, an amazing thing happened. I started noticing and valuing the people who pursued so much more. The ones that didn’t make me put in more work in our friendship (not forever, just in that season), and who let me be messy, angry, sad…whatever I needed to be. The ones who bought my coffee, who held my baby, who said “I’m on my way to say hi” when I was trying to hide myself. They were the ones that didn’t let me crumble in isolation. Be the pursuer. Go sit with them. And don’t expect anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Do say something.&lt;/strong&gt; 
I have a certificate in assault victim counseling-in one of my trainings, I was told an unforgettable truth about trauma: after something significantly traumatic happens (like an assault) to a person, there is a window of ten minutes that will determine how they will view this event for the rest of their lives. Literally, the things I would say to my clients in the hospital could make or break them for the next twenty years of their lives. Will I speak hope? Will I discount their feelings? What would I say that could possibly make this positive? Well, first, I would never try to make something horrific positive. Bad things happen. Accept and recognize that. Recognize the event for what it is: This is a terrible thing…This is an evil thing….This is cruel… Then empathize: I am so sad with you….I am so sad that you’re sad…I wish I could make this better for you. Admit your inability to cure all: I don’t have the solution….I don’t know what to say…I wish I could…And offer hope: I’m with you in this. You’re not alone. I love you. I care for you. I wish I understood, too; but I’m here with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no perfect anecdote to being with someone that is grieving or in pain. I wish there were. People have tried to create ten step programs; but the truth is that, as many people there are in the world (according to the population clock, 7 BILLION)…that’s how many different ways there are to grieve. There is never going to be a cut and dry way to be with someone that’s hurting because people are beautiful and messy and complex and human. But you can be there with them in their grief, and accept their heart where it lays. This holiday, your silence may be the lifeline someone needs to get through their calm and silent night.&lt;/p&gt;

We’re introduced to a creator God as he’s performing his initial acts of work in our world. First, he created the original structure and foundation of everything–heavens and earth, light and darkness, and water, sky, and land. Then came vegetation, sun, moon, and stars in rotation, creatures of the sea, birds of the air, and beasts of the fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He called them good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he did something different. 
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them, and said to them, ‘Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he called it very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the dust of the ground and the breath of God, Adama, the earth creature, the first human, was created. Adama was considered different than the rest of creation and was given dominion over it. More than that, Adama was given creation responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being created in God’s image, in his likeness, meant that he was to also be a creator. And his first creation task was naming the animals, giving them identity. Adama began participating with God in his creation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something changed. If you know the rest of creation story, Adam and Eve disobeyed in the first act of self-interest. And this is important to note, because this original sin–self centeredness–was the act then and continues to be that act today that demotes work from creation to toil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you ascribe to this narrative about the formation of our world or not, I think we can all agree that we have “creator” in our identity, and yet self interest prohibits this. The reason I believe this is so important is that I need to ground myself in God’s original intent for humanity and his identity for me if I am to understand the original structure and intent of the world and everything in it, including work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve been meditating on this, here’s the question I’ve been wrestling with: What is work, and how do we redeem it to its original intention?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In common usage, work is a job, a means of earning an income. The dictionary definition says: “Work is an activity involving effort to achieve a purpose.” But I believe it’s more than that. &lt;strong&gt;I believe work is any act of creation or re-creation that makes the world what it was intended to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original work was creation, and I believe that perspective can and should be redeemed. Our work is creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-centeredness makes work become toil, but we have the opportunity to restore its original characteristics: curiosity, joy, hope, and beauty. We have the opportunity to be creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next post, I’ll dive into what it means to be creators, but I’d love to dwell in these question first: What percentage of my day is toil instead of creation? In what ways do I perpetuate work as toil through self-centeredness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue this conversation as a community, I’d love to know what questions were prompted for you and what challenges you’re facing.

We’re introduced to a creator God as he’s performing his initial acts of work in our world. First, he created the original structure and foundation of everything–heavens and earth, light and darkness, and water, sky, and land. Then came vegetation, sun, moon, and stars in rotation, creatures of the sea, birds of the air, and beasts of the fields.

He called them good.

Then he did something different.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://wayfare.io/uploads/t026fufwmhc-breather.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">3 Steps to Uncover what your Family’s Give Back Passion Is</title><link href="http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/12/06/3-steps-to-uncover-what-your-familys-give-back-passion-is/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="3 Steps to Uncover what your Family's Give Back Passion Is" /><published>2016-12-06T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-12-06T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/12/06/3-steps-to-uncover-what-your-familys-give-back-passion-is</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/12/06/3-steps-to-uncover-what-your-familys-give-back-passion-is/">&lt;p&gt;The holidays typically bring about the sudden urge to get the family together and go out and do some good. While I love the passion everyone has, it can also be quite stressful trying to find what it is you want to do, and how to go do it. I see families get all into a tizzy about it which lead to me getting frantic emails around December 20th saying, “omg, I want to help people. Help me.” I tell ya, it’s quite the job I get to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This season certainly is a great time to highlight how meaningful it is to give when we are inundated with the trappings of getting – getting yummy food, getting presents, getting peppermint mochas, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year if you want to break the cycle (or at least the sugar high) and are considering volunteering with the family, but don’t know where to start, I have a great little guide for you that breaks down what fits your family best. The more personal to the values of your family the better. I recommend getting kids involved and asking them what they think really matters. You’ll have to do the Googling once you uncover your passion, but this will get you where you need to be in terms of how and where you want to give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gone out and volunteered, be sure to recap with the family. Ask them what they liked and didn’t like, if they want to do it again, and how they feel helping others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these three steps, uncover your family’s give back passion. Circle which option makes sense to you and then create your list of what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.The first thing to decide on is who to help.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a personal preference and often will be based on the current demographics of your family, who you’re close to, or something that has impacted you directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homeless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Military&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elderly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Families&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Animals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Ill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.The second element of your giving will be based on where you want to help.&lt;/strong&gt; Are you excited about your local community, or do you have a heart for Malaysia? Decide where you want to make an impact, and tack that onto your list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your neighborhood&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your city&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your county&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your state&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.The final step in uncovering where your family give back passion is, is in thinking about how you want to help.&lt;/strong&gt; Some families are comfortable going down to a local shelter to feed the homeless, and some would rather craft at home and write letters to soldiers – there are options for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hands on service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At-home projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going outside&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being inside&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serving the person you are helping face to face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woo hoo! You now know just how your family can make the biggest impact, for you. No matter what you do this year, we commend you. This season is one of the best to start in on a tradition of giving, of service, and of community.&lt;/p&gt;

In a profound spiritual encounter, I was called out of an 8 year career in banking that had brought comfort and control to me and my family, and God gave me two objectives: 1. Have my identity rooted in him, and 2. Live a life of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I began the transition out of my job and into an unknown adventure where I would begin challenging my previously held understanding of work, a cultural transition was happening in the entertainment industry, which was also challenging my understanding of leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, I was born in the 70s, so my most formative early memories of television were in the 1980s. I would wait in eager anticipation of Sunday nights when the A-team would pull of their next miraculous feat and their fearless leader, Hannibal Smith, would deliver my favorite line: “I love it when a plan comes together.” In fact, I was so captivated by their work that I learned to play their theme song on the piano. It’s actually ringing in my ears right now and giving me energy as I write. But I digress. In the 90s, my curiosity and desire for adventure was catalyzed on Wednesday nights through agents Mulder and Scully of the X-files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we would occasionally and haphazardly tape shows on our VCR, for the most part, we were still eager for the event–not the escape from, but the entrance into a new story, a new adventure, a new possibility. And in the words of modern day prophets, Arcade Fire, “We used to wait for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as VCRs, DVRs, and Netflix ushered the term “binge watching” into our national rhetoric, there was a point when my leisure time began to feel like work. I’m not sure exactly when it happened, but many shows began to feel necessary but burdensome. The began to feel like toil. Obligation. “I just have to make it through this.” “It’s on my list.” Or, I have to watch this so I can compete for social relevancy with my friends. Or my favorite (and most embarrassing): “My wife is watching this show in the next room, and I need to keep up with her.” As I began to become aware of this strange experience, I was initially reluctant to share this with others for fear that I was the only one so dysfunctional, but as I began to carefully broach the topic, I realized–unfortunately–I’m not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this phenomenon has been further engrained in our lives through the storyfication of social media. This week, I’ve found myself habitually defaulting to my Instagram story feed at least once, but let’s be honest, more like 10 times a day, for fear of missing out on the lives of close friends who I could be talking to instead….and strangers who I’ve never met but with whom I have a parasocial relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these two converging shifts, I found myself adopting a holy curiosity about work and leisure that have prompted a deep introspection for me about how I want to live my life, and I know I’m not alone. As we’ve convened creators, doers, and adventurers for the common good in this community we call Wayfare, I’ve engaged in enough conversations and been asked enough compelling questions to prompt a deeper dive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we begin this conversation as a community, I’d love to know what questions you have or what challenges you face in this realm.

It may be cliché, but they wanted to create the best business they could imagine: an excellent brand with a pure heart. They wanted to do something truly good and make the world brighter. 
They talked and bonded and rallied around certain indispensable values. We brainstormed 50 possible names and wrote them on a whiteboard. We lived on iced coffee from Starbucks and Del Taco burritos (and they still have hundreds of hot sauce packets).&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[We] talked about our sincere desire to make the world better. We started with our values and built a business that would embody them”, said Luke Laubhan, Co-Founder &amp;amp; Co-CEO, “We knew we valued inclusiveness, and agreed that unity, positivity (the opposite of cynicism) and honesty are building blocks for a better reality. We aspired to be global. We liked the idea of ‘mankind,’ something that represents all of our infinite potential. [And] finally, Allkiind clicked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the midst of brainstorming and burritos on another 90 degree day, it all took shape. The dream materialized, and Allkiind was born. &lt;strong&gt;Allkiind is a social enterprise that makes lifestyle products, speaks boldly into people and everyday culture, and financially supports a variety of causes and non-profits… all for the common good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allkiind’s chief cause is to truly do good, across every aspect of the company, broadly and openly. Specifically, they’ve focused on three main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They’ve focused on building an ethical and responsible supply chain.&lt;/strong&gt; Allkiind wants to do it right at every level and for them, it means making as much as they can personally and locally where they can see things up close, and holding out for WRAP certification abroad. It also means being intentional about their environmental impact, from using recycled packaging to our own giant, blue recycle bin at HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;**They’re committed to speaking boldly. **Allkiind’s messaging aims to challenge and celebrate. They aspire to positively challenge themselves, others, the status quo, and injustice; and eagerly celebrate the good stuff in life: beauty, people, causes, and victories - there’s so much!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They give back tangibly to good deeds, charitable causes, and non-profits.&lt;/strong&gt; Allkiind is committed to making a tangible impact in the world, rolling up their sleeves and diving in it (for good). So, off the top, Allkiind donates 10% of its revenue to charitable causes and non-profits. There’s no fuzzy math: If a customer buys a $10 item, Allkiind donates $1. When someone spends $100, they donate $10. It really adds up! They select causes and non-profits based on their team’s research and suggestions from the Allkiind community. To be transparent, they post their give-back stories on their blog (it’s a part of the whole celebration thing).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allkiind is just a little over three months old (they launched in August ‘16), and they’ve already inspired and changed lives through their process and products. They’ve been able to provide everything from socks for the local homeless community to Halloween costumes for kids in need. Allkiind has donated school supplies, delivered headbands to those fighting cancer, and financially helped a variety of charitable organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; “With a small staff and a brand new operation, almost every step requires everyone’s time and attention. That said, it’s a uniquely collaborative environment, and it’s fun to be all pulling in the same direction, working on different aspects of the same stuff. It really is a team effort. There’s three of us working in a garage every day, building out a business from scratch. With all the work to do and a great big world in need, it’s not hard to stay focused. To be honest, we still don’t know everything Allkiind will be. That’s part of the adventure. But we do know our values, [and] we feel like we’re just getting started. Operating a business is a journey, and there’s a lot to learn, but our mission fuels us: Allkiind will challenge ourselves and others, and it will celebrate the good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re inspired by the team at AllKiind team and the beautiful way they are pursuing work &amp;amp; the common good. They are a living example of “a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens [that] can change the world”, and they have.&lt;/p&gt;

The natural light from the atrium created this warm glow, but the most impressive light came from the passionate people who worked at Wayfare and I only noticed it more and more as the internship continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What even is an internship? A part time job before an actual job? An internship is not about showing off your strengths, it’s about learning and cultivating them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the very first things the interns did together was take a Strengths Finder test and discuss our results as a group. Totally clueless going into the test, I was so surprised by the results. Not only did I learn the nuances of my strengths, I learned how diverse the other interns and staff were. The beauty of this exercise was that no two people were the same and together we could complement each other to accomplish amazing goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of us could not be any more different. Alandra was a recent college grad with a photography degree, nervous about how far her new art degree could take her. Desiree worked a full time job, Allie had just moved to Orange County from Chicago, and I was still in college, intimidated about being the youngest one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this internship we got to see so many amazing things fulfilled. Interns usually get shafted and degraded into solely getting coffee or filing paperwork. But at Wayfare, we were treated like part of the Wayfare family. Work seriously becomes play when you’re surrounded by rad people and a cute little coffee shop that keeps you highly caffeinated. It’s so refreshing and inspiring to see a community like this dive full force into what they believe while keeping their core values and the common good at the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only were we encouraged to build on our existing strengths, we were all motivated to discover strengths we never knew we had. Alandra learned that she was capable of so much more in just three mere months and that her passion for photography could be implemented into multiple avenues of work. She explored creative direction, social media marketing strategy, visual branding, and story telling with a team that was generous, encouraging, and kind. Deziree was able to utilize her creative side to help with graphics and visuals for various projects and give input in upcoming campaigns. As the front end web development intern, Allie was able grow in her web development skills by taking ownership of website revisions and asset creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I was the youngest intern, my voice was still heard. It was heard most clearly in the captions, content planning, and blog posts that I took ownership of. Every day was an adventure, tailoring stories at Wayfare, exploring the lives of others, and trying to capture that light that I was so enthralled by on the first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light comes streaming in from everyones’ smiles, the passion that drives their dreams, the way they interact with one another and I know we’ve all been so blessed to have this experience and soak in this light for this short internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayfare is about community and you are all a part of that. When you embrace it and run with it, we all become stronger, wiser and more effective. We have learned so much here about leadership and quality work from these humble souls. We are leaving better people and that has been the biggest take away. You can’t buy that or fake it, you have to actually experience the light that flows from here and live it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="internship" /><category term="work" /><category term="strengths" /><summary type="html">The light streaming into the beautiful shared space was the first thing I noticed.

For every blanket that is sold, a Christmas meal is provided to a family living in poverty in Cancun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siestasforfiestas.com&quot;&gt;Siestas For Fiestas&lt;/a&gt; was born out of a desire to support our church in Cancun as they provide Christmas meals for families living in poverty. The church we attended while living in Cancun had a yearly project of providing families with Christmas meals. We were moving back to LA and wanted to find a way to support them. At the same time we had fallen in love with the material our blankets are made out of and thought, why don’t we make beach blankets out of them and sell them to support the church? It started small with just 16 blankets, but has grown significantly in the last year. This is a blessing because the more blankets we sell, the more meals we can provide to families in need.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinners &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siestasforfiestas.com&quot;&gt;Siestas for Fiestas&lt;/a&gt; provides are packaged in a way that families can easily pick up at the local church and take back home to enjoy as a family on Christmas Eve. The meal includes a rotisserie chicken, 2 pounds of soup, 2 pounds of salad, a 2 liter soda, 4 dinner rolls, and paper goods (utensils, plates, and napkins). All is packed inside a reusable container with a sticker that, when translated says, “Jesus goes with me”. By providing families with meals, they are able to share love and hope with families who are really struggling financially. Most of the families they serve live in homes that don’t have electricity or access to water, making it hard for them to have a hot, homemade meal. Christmas is usually spent like any other day, but the meals provided by Siestas for Fiestas give them something special to enjoy with their families. Through this they know they are loved and not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The most life-giving part of our work is knowing that we are being used to provide for God’s people. We have no idea what we’re doing most of the time. We didn’t study fashion and don’t know how to sew, and running a business is hard work. This is why it’s so important to make it a point to focus on our mission &amp;amp; remember why we started when things get hard. We constantly tell ourselves ‘You are feeding a family, this is worth it!’ Knowing we are providing meals to families so they can have a Christmas fiesta keeps us determined through the hard times.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through their mission, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siestasforfiestas.com&quot;&gt;Siestas for Fiestas&lt;/a&gt; is bridging the gap for everyday consumers to be a part of something bigger. Each blanket provides a meal for an entire family, and their customers have the opportunity to buy a blanket and directly bless a family across the world on Christmas day. In the next year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siestasforfiestas.com&quot;&gt;Siestas for Fiestas&lt;/a&gt; will be working closely with their church in Cancun on new projects that create opportunities for those living in poverty so they may provide for themselves and their families to end poverty in the areas surrounding Cancun, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join them in their mission by buying a blanket at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.ticketleap.com/spread-joy/&quot;&gt;Spread Joy Market&lt;/a&gt; here at Wayfare Costa Mesa on Saturday, December 3rd from 11AM-4PM.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="entrepreneur" /><category term="founder" /><category term="social-enterprise" /><category term="impact" /><category term="blankets" /><category term="give-back" /><category term="cancun" /><category term="mexico" /><category term="Christmas" /><category term="siestas" /><category term="fiestas" /><category term="poverty" /><category term="empowerment" /><category term="blanket" /><summary type="html">Focused on a mission to feed Christmas dinners to families in need, Chris &amp;amp; Jesenia Pena created Siestas for Fiestas: blankets that provide hope and meals to families in Cancun, Mexico.

Many of us will gather around tables and perhaps a grown up (gasp … I think I might be that grown up now) may encourage us to say something we are grateful for. Admittedly at times in my past (especially as a teenager) this was an awkward exchange and felt a tad cheesy.  But I think the practice of gratitude deserves some further exploration and it could serve us well to incorporate it into our daily lives, not just around a table once a year. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have been done on the role that gratitude plays in a person’s life.  The book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal&quot;&gt;The Five Minute Journal&lt;/a&gt;, talks about studies that show that the practice of intentional gratitude improves the overall physical and emotional well-being of people.   This begs the question: How do we do that? It is easy to do when things are going well, but often harder to practice when we are experiencing difficult times, loss, grief, or even when we are just having an off day. The practice of gratitude does not not entail ignoring the realities of life, but rather celebrating in the midst of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-steps-to-incorporating-gratitude-into-daily-life&quot;&gt;5 Steps to Incorporating Gratitude into Daily Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are 5 things that I have practiced (sometimes more consistently than others) that have made a real difference for me in living a life of intentional gratitude.  Perhaps they can be a jumping off point for you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-a-gratitude-journal&quot;&gt;Start a Gratitude Journal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get a notebook and start listing what you are thankful for. That’s all. Choose a time in your day whether it be upon waking, while you sip your coffee, around the dinner table, or as you go to bed to intentionally list out 3 things you are thankful for each day. Grab a pen and start writing. Try not to repeat yourself. It is truly amazing that number of things that can be celebrated! It is also a great way to keep a record to look back on during difficult times that can serve as an uplifting tool.  So do it as something you can do to benefit your current self and your future self as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-who-not-just-what&quot;&gt;Focus On Who, Not Just What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If thanksgiving literally means the giving of thanks, then there is naturally someone to whom thanks can be given. This makes the focus not only on what you are thankful for, but takes it a step further and allows you to recognize to whom you can give thanks. As a person who believes in God, I tend to give thanks to God as kind of a catch all for everything I am thankful for. As I’ve been writing this post I have begun to consider the people to whom I can direct my thanks.  So if you aren’t someone who believes in God, or even if you are, try considering which people to whom you could express thanks. For example, being thankful for food can lead us to be thankful for the farmer who grew it,  the worker who harvested it, and the person who stocked the shelves. As I consider who these people are, even though I’ve never met them, it draws an awareness in me that I am just one part of a greater community of people. This allows me to think about a life experience outside of my own, which is a great way to consider the important role each of us plays in our communities, relationships, and the world. So, next to your list of the things you are thankful for, write down who can be thanked as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-people&quot;&gt;Tell People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you consider the people who you can thank, if it is possible, tell them. This act of expressing gratitude draws us into relationship with other people and there is transformative power in living life alongside others, investing in them and being invested in. Expressing gratitude to others can be as simple as a text to your friend telling them that you appreciate the role they play in your life, writing a note and sending it via snail mail, delivering cookies to the local fire or police department, or handing a bottle of water to the person who collects your garbage. At a minimum, practice saying thank you. Sometimes the frantic pace of a day leads me to interact with people and I don’t pause long enough to say thank you for the simple things people do for me every day. The person who makes my coffee, the delivery person who brings the packages, the person who cleans the table at the restaurant or fills my water are all things that I am indeed grateful for, but sometimes I forget to express it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ask-people&quot;&gt;Ask People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who also happens to be a member of the Wayfare community and she asks the best questions. Instead of simply asking the expected “How are you?”, she asks things like, “What are you most looking forward to today?”,  “What is your favorite thing about fall?”, “What are you working on that is really life giving?”. When she asks these questions it always gets me to pause, think, and intentionally reflect upon the good that is a part of every day.  Another way to ask questions that point toward gratitude is the game Highs and Lows. We often play it around the dinner table as a family and it entails each person sharing the best and worst parts of their day. It fully acknowledges that there are hard parts of life and yet there is always room for gratitude even right alongside the not so great stuff. Sometimes when it is a particularly bad day, my default “high” is, “I drank coffee.”  And, let me tell you, I am legitimately thankful that there is always coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-good-thing&quot;&gt;One Good Thing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be real. Sometimes it’s really hard to practice gratitude. This life is full of incredibly wonderful things and horribly heavy things. Sometimes there are seasons where it seems like nothing can possibly be called good. What if in the midst of the thick of it, something good can be found? My thoughts during these times in my own life can go one of two ways. I can spiral into every possible negative outcome of my current circumstances and end up feeling continuously worse and worse or I can acknowledge and experience the sadness for what it is, and then identify one good thing. Just one. It requires some creativity, and it is surprising to me that it is usually the direct result of the current suffering. For example, several of my best friends are people who I met as a direct result of going through some of the darkest seasons of my life. Most of my greatest personal growth has occurred during times of difficulty. Sometimes, when I can’t possibly see anything good in the suffering, I choose to change my focus (even if for a minute) and be thankful for sunshine, chocolate, coffee, and warm blankets. So if you find yourself in a place of struggle and all of this focus on positivity is a bit too much, I want to encourage you to allow yourself to be sad &amp;amp; share that grief with others, but also take a tiny step in the direction of gratitude. If nothing else, in acknowledging and experiencing grief, we can allow these times and seasons to develop relationships with others who have experienced similar challenges, and that is something we can celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this posture of thanksgiving — the giving of thanks—  for things and to others, acknowledging the brokenness of the human existence and the simultaneous beauty of the many things we can celebrate — it is here where there exists the power of gratitude to transform individuals, communities, and in turn, the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="thanksgiving" /><category term="gratitude" /><category term="family" /><category term="grateful" /><category term="thankful" /><category term="journal" /><category term="broken" /><category term="beautiful" /><category term="hardship" /><category term="grief" /><category term="intentional" /><summary type="html">This week our thoughts turn toward pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes, family, friends, and gratitude.
