I’m constantly pushed to improve my skills and strengthen my academic voice as I write papers and finish major projects. Throughout college, one of the most valuable things I have learned is to always seek truth and to raise questions, no matter how big or small they might be. 
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once college is over, I am sure it’s easy to believe that the part of your life devoted to learning is over. Upon finishing a degree, learning could quickly become less of a priority in the face of job and family responsibilities. While the temptation to mold life into an anticipated routine is overwhelmingly strong, the choice to instead challenge yourself by continually pursuing curiosity throughout your adult life can yield incredible results and give you an excitement for life that is unmatched. I’ve watched others do this, and I strive to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve started to think about this process of what it means to cultivate curiosity in my life outside of college course requirements, I’ve thought about how to pursue my passions well. A little less than two years ago, I picked up a camera for the first time and began shooting pictures regularly. Now, photography is a great passion of mine because it’s such a beautiful storytelling mechanism. Photos connect people and create important memories that are imprinted in time. I didn’t learn to love photography through my college courses. I learned to love photography because I was interested in developing a skill and an interest at my own speed.
 
While cultivating curiosity looks different for each person, there are a few different tactics that I’ve found helpful which can make learning more attainable and realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-a-story-about-curiosity&quot;&gt;Listen to a story about curiosity!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this episode from the podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/soundsgoodpodcast/jedidiah-jenkins-the-adventure-of-curiosity&quot;&gt;“Sounds Good”&lt;/a&gt; where Branden Harvey talks with Jeremiah Jenkins on The Adventure of Curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-reading&quot;&gt;Start Reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this takes the form of New York Times articles (the opinion section is my favorite) and every book I can possibly acquire. It’s exciting to tackle another chapter and feel the satisfaction of finally closing a book you’ve worked hard to finish reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;at-the-end-of-every-day-write-down-a-few-new-things-you-have-learned&quot;&gt;At the end of every day, write down a few new things you have learned!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t learned something new, try challenging yourself the next day! Maybe it’s as simple as googling why almond milk is better for your morning coffee than half n’ half or recalling something new that you learned about a person you know. Even small changes to your routine and to your perspective can help broaden the way you see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;travel&quot;&gt;Travel!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking opportunities (however small or limited) to have a change of scenery can greatly expand one’s perspective on the world by teaching you how to communicate with people who are different from you and by physically showing you a very different landscape and way of life. Perhaps this means you can explore a new town close to your home, or it means you decide to take the leap of traveling to Japan like you’ve always dreamed. Travel is also important because it’s an experience that begs you to repeat it. Once you’ve started the journey of exploring new and unique places, you’ll never want to stop. This is a great way to fuel curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-ask-questions&quot;&gt;Always Ask Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to always keep learning is to ask people for their advice, for their stories, for their struggles. Continuing to ask questions opens up a world of possibilities and helps you learn new ideas every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-risks&quot;&gt;Take Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s obviously a great importance in approaching life with wisdom and a good deal of consideration, but stepping outside what is normal, comfortable, and familiar often leads to the most life-changing results. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/startups/idea-weekend/&quot;&gt;Maybe this risk is to start exploring a new idea you have for creating a business!&lt;/a&gt; Maybe the risk is to apologize to that friend and start fresh. Taking risks is hard, but it continually stimulates your brain and pushes you to be a better person by strengthening your goals and your work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cultivating curiosity can be a challenge at times, it is worth all the effort to engage the world and continue growing as an individual. The commitment to learning is one that brings surprises with every turn. Knowledge is an empowering pursuit and helps bring big ideas to life. Don’t forget to dream big dreams and turn them into your next plans! That is what curiosity is really all about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Erin Wilson</name></author><summary type="html">As a college student, most of my learning currently takes place inside a classroom or in a textbook assigned by my professors.

I had just graduated college and was ready for a new adventure. Having fallen in love with the city during previous travels, I thought, “Why not London?” I packed my bags and took off for a three-month internship across the pond. However, upon landing, I immediately asked myself, “What am I doing here?” In all my travel experience, I had never felt homesick before. But rather than letting myself drown in loneliness, I chose to be intentional about connecting with the people I missed back in Orange County by starting an online magazine so that my friends and I could process this life transition together. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started Skyping with a good friend, Jane (whom I lovingly refer to as my “co” because she basically saved my life when it came to building a website and creating an online presence). We picked a website theme, created an Instagram account, and called up all of our recently-graduated friends to ask them how they were processing life after college. After convincing them to write it all down, we released the very first issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://whilstmagazine.com&quot;&gt;Whilst&lt;/a&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst (besides being obnoxiously English) is the word that resides right in the middle of a sentence, the place most people don’t dwell in because they want to get back to the action. It signifies transition—whilst traveling, whilst working, whilst sipping your tea: it’s the word that moves us from the present to the action. That is what we’re about—we want to act as a catalyst for present thinking, to encourage individuals to mindfully enter into their own process and learn the practice of empathizing with others on the same journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to take Whilst farther, to really dive into what the magazine stood for and how I could create a career out of this growing passion. I frequently found myself on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io&quot;&gt;Wayfare website&lt;/a&gt;, and it was during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/startups/idea-weekend/&quot;&gt;Idea Weekend&lt;/a&gt; that I learned how to articulate what Whilst really is and how it could change lives. That’s when I knew I wanted to be a part of a community that exists to change the world for good and create beauty in whatever life stage we are journeying through. The next step, then, was to continue to press into what my vision was for Whilst—how far could this concept of being present in the midst really go? Through sitting down and talking it out with the Wayfare coaches and other entrepreneurs, I found my dreams were bigger than I had imagined. I am continuing to develop and refine my leadership skills now as I continue in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/startups/launch-program/&quot;&gt;Wayfare’s Launch program.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has officially been a year since I took off on a plane and began learning for myself what it means to live in the midst of the process and engage with transition. Whilst Magazine is one year old and we are coming up on our fourth release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/whilstmagazine&quot;&gt;available by subscription&lt;/a&gt; on April 14th! (SO SOON!) I can’t begin to describe how much &lt;a href=&quot;http://whilstmagazine.com&quot;&gt;Whilst&lt;/a&gt; has grown in the last year, let alone the last few weeks at Wayfare, and I am so thankful to be here whilst experiencing it all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Devon Johnson</name></author><category term="Whilst" /><category term="Magazine" /><category term="Travel" /><category term="Creative" /><category term="Writing" /><category term="Idea Weekend" /><category term="Launch Program" /><summary type="html">Everyone starts somewhere, right?

Oh, you too? I’m not surprised. From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1489519329&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=life+changing+magic+of+tidying+up&quot;&gt;Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up&lt;/a&gt; to [Capsule Wardrobes], to &lt;a href=&quot;https://minimalismfilm.com&quot;&gt;Documentaries&lt;/a&gt;…there seems to be an incessant hunt for slowness. Here’s the thing, simplicity and rest are not trends; they are absolute necessities for our survival. 
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many, many opinions and how-to’s on creating space to rest. You can go through all your clothes and throw away whatever doesn’t spark joy (the Kon Mari Method) and download the latest productivity apps (I’m totally into &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minimalist-task-reminder-to-do-list/id993066159?mt=8&quot;&gt;MinimaLIST&lt;/a&gt; right now), but unless we get to the root of our busyness and constant waves of rush, we will never fully enter into rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband is a worship pastor, we have two children under two, and three in school. I work &lt;a href=&quot;https://lettersfromamister.com/what-i-do-i-write/&quot;&gt;freelance as a writer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://heritage-mercantile-co.myshopify.com/collections/events&quot;&gt;teaching workshops&lt;/a&gt; and coaching for blogs and non-profits. His job can take him anywhere from one to ten nights a month, and leaves me alone on the weekends, and mine takes consistent creative juice-flow while wiping high chairs and scrubbing cherrios off the floor (ok, you can’t actually scrub cherrios, but you get the concept, right?)…and, in between all of this, we are called to rest. Yes. Called to rest. Let’s eliminate the buzzword balance and replace it with dance. It is absolutely necessary for us to find the dance, the harmony, between work, and rest, because, if we do not learn to rest well, we cannot impact the world with our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of telling you a list of things you must do, eliminate, or check to create a rhythm of rest in your life, here are some tools I’ve learned as I journey through our chaotic, creative, and beautiful life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop putting pressure on yourself to rest.&lt;/strong&gt; This totally debunks the purpose of it. We get so tangled in knots about making sure we’re resting that we are stressed about getting rest (huh?). Instead, lay out what your ideal routine looks like, then lay out what your survival routine looks like. You will experience both in your life, and it can be a consistent, and, dare I say, beautiful ebb and flow between the two as you navigate through life. Everyday will not be ideal. In fact, most days will not be ideal. Most days, especially those with little people in their care, will be sheer chaos. It’s how we journey through those days that count.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light a Candle.&lt;/strong&gt; I am, however, a huge fan of the Sabbath, and believe it’s something we’re called to do. I believe Sabbath and day offs are two different beasts to tackle; that one is for oil changes and raking leaves, and the other is for pausing and letting life happen around you, while you completely let go of your daily agenda, responsibilities, and worries to worship. How we do this is, come Sunday afternoon, after the busiest time of week for us (remember, pastor family), we light a candle to initiate the end of busy and the beginning of Sabbath. I make the same meal in the crockpot every single Sunday, I clean the house deeply so that come Sunday night and Monday morning I can breathe and be present with my family without noticing the crumbs on the floor, I delete social media from my phone and have our kids turn off their devices and put them in a drawer. We shut down, gathering around the table with a candle resting in the middle, and play the question game, then gather in the living room for board games or reading, or just being quiet, but present, together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create quiet hours.&lt;/strong&gt; One thing we love to do, and don’t do nearly enough, are quiet hours. I have carried this false belief for years that I must be able to do anything, everything, always. No matter how crazy the kids are, or how insane my husband’s ministry is, or how close my work deadlines are, I thought I needed to roll with it to show how strong I am. The reality is, rest reveals strength. I had to come to terms with the fact that I need set, sacred spaces of total silence, or I will lose my (insert appropriate emoji here). We decided to implement quiet hours with our kids after realizing (one) we hate screens and (two) kids hate life without screens. We believe in the power of boredom, and that creativity can spring from giving ourselves, and our loved ones, spaces without forced stimulation. So, in our ideal schedule, we have an hour a day of no screens and of total quiet. Sometimes we’ll have some easy music on, and this usually takes place during the toddler’s naptime. Each person is responsible for finding their own silent activity, whether it’s making paper airplanes, reading a book, scrolling through a blog (for me! It’s a rule bend because it’s an important way I experience rest), making a slow, pour over coffee. This is not family play time, this is not time to engage, but rather to step back so we can come together and be fully, fully present with each other when we do choose to reconnect. Our kids have come to love it so much that if we don’t have it for a few days, they actually start to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is absolutely necessary for us to find the dance, the harmony, between work, and rest, because, if we do not learn to rest well, we cannot impact the world with our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, there is no simple formula or perfect way to create rhythms of rest in our lives. There are tools and opinions that can be helpful, but don’t bombard yourself with research in a hunt for the perfect experience. The secret, my secret, is to accept the season of life you are in at the present, and embrace what the dance between work and rest looks like for you today. Recognize your ideal rhythm, and implement a variation of that into your current season. By implementing sacred space to rest, your work will be more impactful and life-giving for not only yourself, but the world you are serving.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sally Kim</name></author><category term="rest" /><category term="minimalism" /><summary type="html">Simplicity, Sabbath, Kon Mari, Minimalism, Balance…being in the creative industry, primarily in the blogging world, I hear these words a lot.

So when a day goes by where I haven’t achieved all of the things that I set out to do in a day, I have a hard time feeling like I have accomplished anything at all. This tends to be a problem for me because as the cofounder of a small, but growing organization, I know what it is like to have an entire day go by and to be left wondering where all of my time went! At the end of the day, even if I’ve been productive and I’ve clearly made progress in several small areas, if I spent very little time executing on my primary objectives it can feel defeating.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I’ve had to do as I’ve started and run various companies are: run payroll, file DBAs, register domain names, pay bills, build websites, create financial projections, open bank accounts, pull together tax information, communicate with lawyers, act as tech support, communicate with investors, mop up spills, schedule meetings, book travel plans, manage inventory, develop content, ideate on revenue streams, speak at events, pitch investors, order soap dispensers, plunge toilets, install thermostats, run sound, and build furniture. The list could go on, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Obviously the specific tasks you have to juggle vary depending on the nature of your business or organization and your role. But the reality is, you wear many hats. &lt;strong&gt;It it the nature of running a business. It is the nature of freelance work. It is the nature of starting something new. And it can be overwhelming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say, I’m sure many of you can resonate with attempting to juggle the many things that go into running the various aspects of your business. Some you love, some you don’t. But you do them all, because they’re necessary for you to do… at least at first. We tell founders in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/startups/&quot;&gt;Launch program&lt;/a&gt; that whether you plan to stay small or grow, &lt;strong&gt;having your hand in everything at the beginning is an essential part of the process for the long run&lt;/strong&gt;. After having done many of the things, as time has gone on I’ve been able to better navigate exactly what to do myself, what to hire out, and who to hire to do some of these things. But having done many of them at first, helped me know who to hire for specific roles. It’s also helped me understand which methods and tools I use to help me manage what I need to get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love learning about new methods and user-friendly web-based tools that can can help me manage all of the different categories of tasks that I find myself completing. However, researching the best methods and tools &lt;strong&gt;just takes more time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m thrilled to share this free downloadable guide called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.activehosted.com/f/18&quot;&gt;16 Apps &amp;amp; Strategies for Streamlining Your Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that was written by one of our coworking members, &lt;a href=&quot;http://setterstudios.com&quot;&gt;Brandon Setter&lt;/a&gt;, filmmaker and unofficial king of efficiency.

It’s the ugly voice of comparison. This voice leads to one of two problematic feelings for me: inferiority or superiority. Because the truth about comparison is that it goes both ways. It’s the voice that says what I do doesn’t matter, because someone else is doing something better. It is the voice that minimizes what others do because I don’t see the value in it or understand it. It’s the voice that tells me I don’t have anything to offer because I don’t have everything together. It’s the voice that also says I don’t need to feel too bad about my shortcomings, because at least I’m not quite as much of a mess as so-and-so. But today I’d like to boldly declare, regardless of what it says, &lt;strong&gt;the voice of comparison is a liar.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we compare ourselves to others, for better or for worse, is ultimately because we want our lives to matter. I know that I am not alone in this and so today I’d like to invite you to join me in listening to a different voice. One that doesn’t guide us to a place of self-deprecation &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; to a place of arrogance, but to a place of considering the unique role that we each have. This voice asks the question, &lt;strong&gt;“What is your best contribution to the world?”&lt;/strong&gt; The answer to this question is always the same answer. For everyone. No matter what. The answer to the question, “What is your best contribution to the world?”, is quite simply, ‘You.” &lt;strong&gt;Your best contribution to the world is you.&lt;/strong&gt; Your abilities, your resources and talents, and your relationships and experiences are uniquely yours. And that matters. You can contribute to the world by doing what you can, with what you have, where you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no need to compare yourself to somebody else in order to determine how much you matter, because the world needs you to be &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that we have that cleared up. We face another question.  What happens if I don’t quite know what my abilities, resources or talents are?  What if I can’t make sense of the place I currently am or the relationships I currently have? Here’s the fun part. You go on an adventure of self discovery and try things out. Here are a few ways to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;find-what-you-like-to-do&quot;&gt;Find What You Like to Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identify some activities or hobbies that you like. Find others that share those interests and build relationships with them. Here are a few ideas to start: Join a book club, attend a workout class, gather friends for a monthly supper club, sign up for a class or workshop, play basketball with some friends, play the guitar, learn a new craft that you’ve always wanted to try, take your dog to a dog park, take a walk around your neighborhood and talk to your neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find ways you can use what you like to better the life of someone else. Love to cook? Bring someone a meal. Love a certain sport? Gather some friends for an intramural league or volunteer to coach a youth team or help at a sports camp. Enjoy gardening? What neighbor or coworker wouldn’t love a homegrown bouquet or a few fresh tomatoes or oranges? Find something that you like and consider how to bless others or invite others in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/StrengthsFinder-2-0-Tom-Rath/dp/159562015X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1487737297&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=strengths+finder+2.0&quot;&gt;The Strengths Finder 2.0&lt;/a&gt; is a great book and comes with a code that gives you access to a highly comprehensive online assessment tool to help you identify your strengths. The basic premise of this book is that we often can identify our short-comings easily and spend a lot of effort to overcome them.  However, there are parts of us where we naturally excel and most of our effort should go toward developing our strengths. At Wayfare, we use this book in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/startups/&quot;&gt;startup incubator&lt;/a&gt; and have found that it’s worth every penny. (And we don’t get paid a penny to promote this book. We just really love it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may or may not be living where you want to, working where you want to, or are at the place you thought you’d be at this point in your life. Either way, no matter where you are, you can contribute to the world.  Your neighbors, your friends, your coworkers, your family and the people in your city can benefit from the fact that you are in their lives. My friend recently left a couple of balloons and a nice card with a treat attached for each of her neighbors in their driveways as they got home from work. Another person I know lives in a third-world country, doesn’t have running water, and helps provide medical care to people in her community.  Some other friends of mine love babies and step in to &lt;a href=&quot;http://safe-families.org&quot;&gt;help families in crisis&lt;/a&gt; by temporarily caring for their children. Another friend of mine makes school lunches for her boys. She’s started offering to make lunches for their classmates as well. Moms take her up on it and when asked why she does it she says, “Because I can. And if I’m doing it anyway I might as well make someone else’s life easier by helping them out.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facesofsantaana.com&quot;&gt;Someone else I know&lt;/a&gt; befriends people experiencing homelessness, uses his skills as an artist to paint their portraits, sells the paintings, and uses the funds to help his friends in a tangible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me? Today, I made meals for my family, washed their clothes, and helped my son with math. Obviously I wrote a blog post too. It’s my hope that in my family they know they are loved and in turn, they love others. It’s my hope that in my writing, I can encourage others. I also went to the chiropractor. Because I have to take care of myself too. It isn’t much, but it isn’t &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; much, you know? It’s just me. Because it’s what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have to offer.  To my family, to my community, to myself in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We each have our roles. And they each matter. Let’s say ‘no’ to the voice of comparison, and ‘yes’ to contributing to the world in our own unique ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="creativity" /><category term="purpose" /><category term="ideas" /><category term="world" /><category term="homeless" /><category term="strengths" /><category term="relationships" /><summary type="html">There’s a not so subtle voice that wells up inside of me more often than I’d like to admit. It’s the ugly voice of comparison. This voice leads to one of two problematic feelings for me: inferiority or superiority. Because the truth about comparison is that it goes both ways. It’s the voice that says what I do doesn’t matter, because someone else is doing something better. It is the voice that minimizes what others do because I don’t see the value in it or understand it. It’s the voice that tells me I don’t have anything to offer because I don’t have everything together. It’s the voice that also says I don’t need to feel too bad about my shortcomings, because at least I’m not quite as much of a mess as so-and-so. But today I’d like to boldly declare, regardless of what it says, the voice of comparison is a liar.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://wayfare.io/uploads/comparison-blog-resized.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">“But What Do I Doooo?”: The Case for a Strong Mission Statement</title><link href="http://wayfare.io/stories/2017/02/19/but-what-do-i-doooo-the-case-for-a-strong-mission-statement/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;But What Do I Doooo?&quot;: The Case for a Strong Mission Statement" /><published>2017-02-19T17:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-19T17:27:00+00:00</updated><id>http://wayfare.io/stories/2017/02/19/but-what-do-i-doooo-the-case-for-a-strong-mission-statement</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://wayfare.io/stories/2017/02/19/but-what-do-i-doooo-the-case-for-a-strong-mission-statement/">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite movies is Disney’s “The Kid”. In the scene where big Russ is trying to explain his job as an image consultant and little Rusty is trying to understand what that means, he looks up and in a childish, drawn out tone says, “But what do I doooo?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This very phrase and in Rusty’s tone went through my head about 1,000 times as we started exploring re-articulating our mission statement. I was newly hired as the Executive Director of Mika Community Development Corporation but had been a part of the organization for 11 of our 12 years. Our work wasn’t changing but we needed to clarify and focus the most core part of our work, our mission.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Mika’s mission statement read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mika exists to identify and equip leaders from low-income neighborhoods to build communities with VISION (Vision, Interdependent Relationships with God and with each other, Servant Leadership, Impact, Organization, and Networks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not a bad mission statement. It served us well and directed our work for over a decade. However, besides myself and the previous Executive Director, no one could remember the thing. You’d ask 10 people what Mika did and you’d get 10 different answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to tell you this process of asking, “But what do we dooooo?” was simple and fast. But as with most things that are good, it took time. A lot of time. Just over a year to be exact. This was not a process to be rushed and clarifying the core problem we were addressing was the ONLY way we were going to know if our solutions were actually solving anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be scary, because what if the answer is no? &lt;strong&gt;What if you get really clear on the problem only to find what you’ve been doing isn’t really solving the core problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my 12 years of working with and for multiple non-profits, I’ve seen that we’re often afraid of asking the hard questions. It could affect our funding. It could mean stopping or changing long term programs. It could mean saying no to funds that don’t align with our mission. It could mean people choosing not to partner with you anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of you starting something new, this could also mean that your idea looks different than what you have been thinking about for years. But the freedom of clarity and focus far outweighs the anxieties and frustrations that come from lack of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mika’s work draws heavily from Bryant Myers’ book “Walking With the Poor” where he presents the idea of relational poverty and its effect on economic poverty. He suggests that “poverty is a result of relationships that do not work, that are not just, that are not for life, that are not harmonious or enjoyable. Poverty is the absence of Shalom in all its meanings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was made more accessible by the popular “When Helping Hurts” and explores the effects of the breakdown in relationship of our four primary relationships – our relationships with God, with self, with others, and with the rest of creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been using this language to explain the core problem we were addressing and justify how we work, but hadn’t connected that the way we articulated our mission spoke more to strategy than mission fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership Development and Community Building (our core strategies) are wonderful things but they are tools to fulfilling a larger mission. We identified early on in the process that our core mission had to be articulated in relationship terms. If you’ve ever wordsmithed something for so long it makes your brain hurt, you’ll understand how we were feeling after months of not landing on something concrete. I could walk you through all the versions and would be happy to if you contact me directly, but where we finally landed was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mika exists to build whole relationships in Costa Mesa.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be fooled by the simplicity of this statement. There was a lot of time (and tears) that went into the final iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clarity this statement brought to me and to our team was incredible. It created a clear lens to evaluate every single thing we do. We asked: does this program build wholeness in relationship with God, self, or others? For 80% of what we did the answer was a resounding YES! If the answer was no, another set of questions followed. Not fitting into our core mission didn’t automatically mean we needed to stop doing something, but clarified what questions we should be asking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the hardest decisions I’ve made as Executive Director were closing a community center and changing a 10 year Christmas tradition that had become an institution in our city. I realized that even the most beautiful community development work can become a part of sustaining a need that has changed or may not even exist anymore. Once we became really clear on the problem we were addressing (broken relationships) we had to make sure our solutions (strategies and programs) were completely in line. To sum this up in one short post is oversimplifying a very difficult and timely process, but as one that’s still in it (and will hopefully always be asking the hard questions) I’m here to tell you it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in Wayfare’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/startups/idea-weekend/&quot;&gt;Idea Weekend&lt;/a&gt; from a different perspective than most of the people in the room. I wasn’t starting something brand new but had a new idea for our already existing organization. We had done a lot of the above mentioned work and started asking some specific questions regarding funding and sustainability. It was inspiring to be with 14 other people who were vulnerable enough to ask the hard questions and do the hard work of clarifying their problem in order to know what the best solutions were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was the case with many people in the room, what I started thinking was the problem was only scratching the surface and attending the Idea Weekend helped me to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What seems like a very scary and hard process of questioning is totally worth it in the end when you’re willing to do the work. Well done for diving in.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Keturah Kennedy</name></author><category term="startups" /><category term="startup" /><category term="insight" /><category term="mission" /><category term="statement" /><category term="why" /><category term="mika" /><category term="costa mesa" /><category term="the kid" /><category term="non-profit" /><category term="social enterprise" /><category term="when helping hurts" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="clarity" /><category term="focus" /><category term="sustainability" /><category term="funding" /><summary type="html">One of my favorite movies is Disney’s “The Kid”.

That’s a big deal. Whether you’ve been at it for awhile or you are just starting out, you might find yourself exploring the idea of moving to your own office space. Next step…secure a lease, right? Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve asked a few of the members that work out Wayfare full time why they have chosen to have their offices and build their team inside of the a shared workspace environment rather than in their own private office space. A few main themes came up: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/membership/&quot;&gt;The Community&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/membership/faq/&quot;&gt;The Flexibility&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io/startups/&quot;&gt;Business Opportunities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-community-for-you-and-your-team&quot;&gt;The Community (for you and your team)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We love having our own personal space, but I also love seeing how my team is part of the greater community of people within Wayfare. The community here is like-minded, which is a huge deal. They care about people and I think it helps my team have a better work experience than we’d have if our team was isolated in our own space without interaction and encouragement from others…It’s more than a workspace, it’s a family.”-Jon F., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cappital.co&quot;&gt;Cappital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I came from working alone in a windowless office to a place where there is life happening to the fullest. I no longer leave my day exhausted and drained, but with new ideas, new questions, and a new sense of energy to take me into the next day.-Erica N., &lt;a href=&quot;http://redemptionchurch.org&quot;&gt;Redemption Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wayfare fosters a unique culture and brings together a big family. This aligns with the philosophy that’s deeply rooted in [our] business.-Han L., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moraleagency.com&quot;&gt;Morale Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wholeheartedly agree! Running your own business or organization is hard and can be draining. It is great to be able to share some of the things that are going on in your work and receive encouragement from others who have walked or are walking the same path. Sometimes all you need is the encouragement to keep going or some insight that you’d likely never come up with on your own. That is where being surrounded by other people outside of your own organization is a huge help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When you are starting something new and growing your team it is impossible to know how quickly or how slowly you’ll grow. The month-to-month flexibility and the ability to add employees as we grow is the perfect solution for us. We don’t need to keep moving offices as we add more people. We keep our dedicated office and just add employees who can work out of the main coworking space and the office.-Jon. F., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cappital.co&quot;&gt;Cappital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a dedicated office space at Wayfare you are welcome to work in the main workspace as well. This is a great option if you are looking for a change of scenery or to accommodate a growing team.  As you make new hires, you can easily add them on without needing to move offices. At Wayfare you aren’t committed to an office lease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“To put it simply, Neat Coffee would not currently exist without Wayfare. Not only have you provided me with a space in which to test out my dreams, but you have been so supportive and helpful from the second the idea was born. From creating projections for my business, to giving great advice on a weekly basis…you have played an integral role in making Neat Coffee successful.-Ally G., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neat.coffee&quot;&gt;Neat Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Having the ability to make connections and interact with people within the greater coworking community provides natural ways to connect and grow our business, gain customers and connections, and explore new ideas. Being a part of this community allows us to get to know other people who can speak into what we are doing and see things from a new perspective because they have an outside point of view that we don’t have.-Jon F., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cappital.co&quot;&gt;Cappital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I love this sentiment and often encourage my kids (and myself for that matter) to think in this way. But in reality, don’t both matter? Truth without kindness tends to fall on deaf ears, and kindness without truth really isn’t kind, its flattery. True kindness comes from a desire for the best possible outcome for everyone involved. This usually entails working together. Not just tolerating someone who is occupying space in close proximity to you, but actually doing work in cooperation with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From people on your team at work, to people you rub shoulders with in a shared workspace (yay coworking!), to working with and advocating on behalf of others, working together is important. As we identify needs and consider how to help, it often means working with people who are different than us. This could mean working with the person or people responsible for the problem you are trying to solve. It could mean joining someone very different than you who feels called to the same work. It could mean working to keep relationships in tact even when we disagree on a lot. We all encounter moments when differences come to the surface and we need to work together to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If working together is important, how do we accomplish the important work? These two phrases may help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-why-not-both&quot;&gt;1. “Why Not Both?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make thousands of tiny decisions every day and most of the time we don’t even realize it. In these tiny instances “either/or” decision making is fairly inconsequential. Deciding on things like jeans or shorts, pizza or mac and cheese, and the freeway or surface streets can usually be solved easily and without much consequence. (Although as a side note: I do think mac and cheese pizza is pretty amazing. Don’t knock it until you try it. Unless you are lactose intolerant. Then definitely don’t try it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to the more significant things in life where a person’s personal, religious, or moral convictions come to the surface, that is where the tensions typically arise. So when these situations present themselves, turning off the autopilot of the “either/or” thinking we use thousands of times every day can be beneficial as we work together. These delicate situations entail more thoughtful work. This is where “both/and” thinking comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core “both/and” thinking and decision making starts with listening to the other perspective and working together to see if there is a way to accomplish a positive outcome for each person, rather than choosing either one or the other. This often results in the emergence of a never before considered third way (I repeat: MAC AND CHEESE PIZZA!!!). It is fascinating to see what comes of asking the question, “Why Not Both?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, can a person BOTH hold their personal convictions strongly, AND respect the right of another to hold their own (differing) personal convictions just as strongly no matter how much they disagree? Absolutely. And in this very act…they can each find something on which they agree which a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently heard an eyewitness report of a protest happening at LAX regarding the executive order banning travel and immigration that the President recently made. The protestors were in the way of traffic. The police came and told the protestors that if they remained in the street, they would get arrested. Shortly thereafter, it was reported that an agreement was struck between the police and the protestors. It was decided that the protestors could alternate standing in the street for a specified amount of time thus allowing their protest to remain a protest and not just a demonstration. Then they would retreat to the sidewalk for a specified amount of time before taking the protest back to the street and so on. The police didn’t need to make mass arrests and the protestors were still able to protest in an effective way. While I wasn’t there and can’t speak first-hand to the validity of this report, this struck me as an example of “both/and” thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-help-me-understand&quot;&gt;2. “Help Me Understand”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I was feeling particularly frustrated as I found myself navigating a difficult friendship. I was seeking advice from a couple of friends and in our conversation I exclaimed, “It is just so messy!” To which they both responded. “When you’re interacting with real people, in real life, that’s exactly what it is…messy.”  And in their kindness they didn’t leave me hanging, but encouraged me to use these three words – “Help Me Understand”. I now use those three words at least weekly in a variety of circumstances. Some examples: “Help me understand your thought process.” “Help me understand how you reached this conclusion.” “Help me understand what your experience is like in this.” “Help me understand what benefits you see in this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we aspire to work together to advance good in the world, these two simple phrases might make a world of difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="work" /><category term="life" /><category term="common-good" /><summary type="html">I’ve heard it said that if there is a choice to be right or be kind, choose kindness.

&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything like me, you talk about practicing your Spanish more than you actually find time to do it. For many people, it’s been since high school, which, is getting further and further away. Our lives are busy and sometimes it’s hard to figure out a time to practice a foreign language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applies for many of our native Spanish speaking neighbors here in Costa Mesa. Because of this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikacdc.org&quot;&gt;Mika&lt;/a&gt; recently launched Language Learning Night.

A night once a month where native English and Spanish speakers are both teacher and learner all in the same evening.  You get to feel awkward and unsure for half the evening and confident and helpful for the other half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mikacdc.org&quot;&gt;Mika’s&lt;/a&gt; mission is to build whole relationships. Part of building relationships is the ability to put ourselves out there and feel unsure. I love the quote by Nelson Mandela that says, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.” It’s our desire to foster an environment during our Language Learning Nights to not only help people gain more practical knowledge, but to also hear from each other’s heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darren, one of the native English participants says this of his experience, “The language exchange is a beautiful opportunity to get to know our neighbors in a setting where we all feel a little vulnerable. Speaking a foreign language to native speakers can be nerve-racking, but as we go back and forth between English and Spanish, I’m reminded that we all are learning and practicing. I was worried about feeling dumb when I’m trying to speak Spanish, but everyone has been super patient and encouraging!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a native Spanish speaker, Loly has said this: “My experience at the Language Learning Night was amazing. This class is very important for me, not only because I have to learn English, but because is part of my daily lifestyle. Due to the way we practice a foreign language, it helps build my confidence with communicating with more people around me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all want to hear and be heard; to learn and share what we’ve learned. Are you ready to share your language and make some new friends? This is a free night of learning and relationship building hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.io&quot;&gt;Wayfare Costa Mesa&lt;/a&gt;.

One way they’re doing this is through Language Learning Nights hosted by Wayfare Costa Mesa. If you’re anything like me, you talk about practicing your Spanish more than you actually find time to do it. For many people, it’s been since high school, which, is getting further and further away. Our lives are busy and sometimes it’s hard to figure out a time to practice a foreign language. The same applies for many of our native Spanish speaking neighbors here in Costa Mesa. Because of this, Mika recently launched Language Learning Night.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://wayfare.io/uploads/mika-language-learning.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Say Goodbye to “Wayfare”</title><link href="http://wayfare.io/stories/2017/01/18/say-goodbye-to-wayfare/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Say Goodbye to &quot;Wayfare&quot;" /><published>2017-01-18T21:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-18T21:12:00+00:00</updated><id>http://wayfare.io/stories/2017/01/18/say-goodbye-to-wayfare</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://wayfare.io/stories/2017/01/18/say-goodbye-to-wayfare/">&lt;p&gt;Hey there,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a new year and we have big news. We started dreaming about what Wayfare would become over three years ago. It was our vision to create a workspace and support for organizations that would birth movements for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were forming the organization, we decided on the name Wayfare because it captured the heart behind our vision. The word Wayfare has a double meaning. It means the act of journeying. It also means provisions for the journey. This word clearly encompassed the community we envisioned—a community of creators, doers, and adventurers aspiring to pursue the common good and support each other in the journey.

Around the same time that we decided to name our company Wayfare, another company with a different mission (they sell furniture) called Wayfair was on the rise. They sell furniture at “way fair” prices and made news as they received hundreds of millions in capital investment that year. As we became aware of their company, we explored the potential of any conflict associated with our names sounding the same. We didn’t see any conflict, and our lawyers agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently however, their lawyers did not. We appreciate great furniture as much as anyone, and we even have a few items procured through our very own orders from wayfair.com itself. However, we are faced with a decision. We must decide how much time, energy, and money we want to spend in legal fees (the quick answer is zero…nobody wants to pay legal fees) to continue down the path of fighting to keep our name. We’ve chosen a different path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our startup programs, we advise organizations to quickly assess environmental changes and the big picture when experiencing challenges – to make sense of the situation and rapidly adjust. So we’ve taken our own advice and have decided to change our name while staying true to who we are…who you are. We’re going to redirect our energy and steward our resources in a positive direction to rename this community, and we want you, the community, included in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the name Wayfare is a great representation of our mission and this community, when we look at the big picture, we are struck with the amazing people that form this community, the wonderful hearts you have, and world-changing work you are doing. For that reason, we are thrilled to invite you into the process of renaming Wayfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are humbled and full of gratitude that the community of three who decided on the name is now a community of over 200 members who work out of the workspaces or are currently participating in the startup programs. There are thousands of others who serve as advisors, have attended events, or have joined us on social media. You’ve been a part of this journey so far, and we want to continue this adventure along with you. YOU are Wayfare and we’re happy to release the name, because the community and the journey we are all on together matter more. And that is where we want to continue to invest the resources we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, let’s go on another adventure together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re having a contest to come up with a new name (yes, there are prizes) and we want &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; the ideas. We invite you to submit a name (or 20) for our rebranding, and the guidelines are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The name captures our goals of having spaces where people can daily be supported in meaningful work (workspaces) AND simultaneously captures the mission of guiding founders and startups of missional enterprises and social good organizations (startup programs).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The name communicates the concept of adventure, journeying, support, and encouragement in pursuit of the common good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bonus points if the .com of the name is available or there’s an instagram/twitter handle available (but we can work around this, so if you have the perfect name submit it anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra bonus points if you submit a catchy hashtag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;action&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.typeform.com/to/DFBRl1&quot;&gt;Submit your ideas and an explanation&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit as many ideas as you want as many times as you want.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyone can participate (you don’t need to be a member to share your ideas)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All submissions must be received by January 31st at 10 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prize&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One winner will receive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A $500 credit to be used toward our &lt;a href=&quot;/startups&quot;&gt;Startup Programs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/workspaces&quot;&gt;Workspaces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/workspaces&quot;&gt;Meeting Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;Event Fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$50 gift certificate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sidecardoughnuts.com&quot;&gt;Sidecar Doughnuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$20 gift card to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neat.coffee&quot;&gt;Neat Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swag bag of goods with new branding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our eternal gratitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get your thinking caps on and let’s embark on the next phase of this journey together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With extreme gratitude and excitement for the world’s best future,&lt;/p&gt;
