Many of us will gather around tables and perhaps a grown up (gasp … I think I might be that grown up now) may encourage us to say something we are grateful for. Admittedly at times in my past (especially as a teenager) this was an awkward exchange and felt a tad cheesy.  But I think the practice of gratitude deserves some further exploration and it could serve us well to incorporate it into our daily lives, not just around a table once a year. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have been done on the role that gratitude plays in a person’s life.  The book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal&quot;&gt;The Five Minute Journal&lt;/a&gt;, talks about studies that show that the practice of intentional gratitude improves the overall physical and emotional well-being of people.   This begs the question: How do we do that? It is easy to do when things are going well, but often harder to practice when we are experiencing difficult times, loss, grief, or even when we are just having an off day. The practice of gratitude does not not entail ignoring the realities of life, but rather celebrating in the midst of them, both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-steps-to-incorporating-gratitude-into-daily-life&quot;&gt;5 Steps to Incorporating Gratitude into Daily Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are 5 things that I have practiced (sometimes more consistently than others) that have made a real difference for me in living a life of intentional gratitude.  Perhaps they can be a jumping off point for you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-a-gratitude-journal&quot;&gt;Start a Gratitude Journal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get a notebook and start listing what you are thankful for. That’s all. Choose a time in your day whether it be upon waking, while you sip your coffee, around the dinner table, or as you go to bed to intentionally list out 3 things you are thankful for each day. Grab a pen and start writing. Try not to repeat yourself. It is truly amazing that number of things that can be celebrated! It is also a great way to keep a record to look back on during difficult times that can serve as an uplifting tool.  So do it as something you can do to benefit your current self and your future self as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-who-not-just-what&quot;&gt;Focus On Who, Not Just What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If thanksgiving literally means the giving of thanks, then there is naturally someone to whom thanks can be given. This makes the focus not only on what you are thankful for, but takes it a step further and allows you to recognize to whom you can give thanks. As a person who believes in God, I tend to give thanks to God as kind of a catch all for everything I am thankful for. As I’ve been writing this post I have begun to consider the people to whom I can direct my thanks.  So if you aren’t someone who believes in God, or even if you are, try considering which people to whom you could express thanks. For example, being thankful for food can lead us to be thankful for the farmer who grew it,  the worker who harvested it, and the person who stocked the shelves. As I consider who these people are, even though I’ve never met them, it draws an awareness in me that I am just one part of a greater community of people and allows me to consider an experience outside my own, which is a great way to consider the role important role each of us plays in our communities, relationships, and the world. So, next to your list of the things you are thankful for, write down who can be thanked as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-people&quot;&gt;Tell People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you consider the people who you can thank, if it is possible, tell them. This act of expressing gratitude draws us into relationship with other people and there is transformative power in living life alongside others, investing in them and being invested in. Expressing gratitude to others can be as simple as a text to your friend telling them that you appreciate the role they play in your life, writing a note and sending it via snail mail, delivering cookies to the local fire or police department, or handing a bottle of water to the person who collects your garbage. At a minimum, practice saying thank you. Sometimes the frantic pace of a day leads me to interact with people and I don’t pause long enough to say thank you for the simple things people do for me every day. The person who makes my coffee, the delivery person who brings the packages, the person who cleans the table at the restaurant or fills my water are all things that I am indeed grateful for, but sometimes I forget to express it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ask-people&quot;&gt;Ask People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who also happens to be a member of the Wayfare community and she asks the best questions. Instead of simply asking the expected “How are you?”, she asks things like, “What are you most looking forward to today?”,  “What is your favorite thing about fall?”, “What are you working on that is really life giving?”. When she asks these questions it always gets me to pause, think, and intentionally reflect upon the things that I am thankful for.  Another way to ask questions that point toward gratitude is the game Highs and Lows. We often play it around the dinner table as a family and it entails each person sharing the best and worst parts of their day. It fully acknowledges that there are hard parts of life and yet there are is always room for gratitude even right alongside the not so great stuff. Sometimes when it is a particularly bad day, my default “high” is, “I drank coffee.”  And, let me tell you, I am legitimately thankful that there is always coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-good-thing&quot;&gt;One Good Thing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be real. Sometimes its really hard to practice gratitude. This life is full of incredibly wonderful things and horribly heavy things. Sometimes there are seasons where it seems like nothing can possibly be called good. What if in the midst of the thick of it, something good can be found? My thoughts during these times in my own life can go one of two ways. I can spiral into every possible negative outcome of my current circumstances and end up feeling continuously worse and worse or I can acknowledge and experience the sadness for what it is, and then identify one good thing. Just one. It requires some creativity, and it is surprising to me that it is usually the direct result of the current suffering. For example, several of my best friends are people who I met as a direct result of going through some of the darkest seasons of my life. Most of my greatest personal growth has occurred during times of difficulty. Sometimes, when I can’t possibly see anything good in the suffering, I choose to change my focus (even if for a minute) and be thankful for sunshine, chocolate, coffee, and warm blankets. So if you find yourself in a place of struggle and all of this focus on positivity is a bit too much, I want to encourage you to allow yourself to be sad &amp;amp; share that grief with others, but also take a tiny step in the direction of gratitude. If nothing else, in acknowledging and experiencing grief, we can allow these times and seasons to develop relationships with others who have experienced similar challenges, and that is something we can celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this posture of thanksgiving — the giving of thanks—  for things and to others, acknowledging the brokenness of the human existence and the simultaneous beauty of the many things we can celebrate — it is here where there exists the power of gratitude to transform individuals, communities, and in turn, the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="thanksgiving" /><category term="gratitude" /><category term="family" /><category term="grateful" /><category term="thankful" /><category term="journal" /><category term="broken" /><category term="beautiful" /><category term="hardship" /><category term="grief" /><category term="intentional" /><summary type="html">This week our thoughts turn toward pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes, family, friends, and gratitude.

Through the sale of high-quality leather goods, they are creating jobs for people coming out of human trafficking in Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founder Ian Bentley tells the story behind Parker Clay, and the experience that moved him and his wife Brittany to act on the problem they were experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Back in 2008 we were moved by the number of orphans living in the world. Some statistics place the numbers at 163 million orphans worldwide. While those statistics are alarming, and we looked at these numbers and said, “What if that was Parker or Clayton?”, our two biological children. From that moment, the journey to Ethiopia started and in 2011 when we brought home our Ethiopian daughter, Selah, who was 5 months old at the time. While in Ethiopia we spent time with a number of organizations looking for ways to address some of the root causes to poverty and the disruption of family. It was soon after this that we packed up our lives and moved to Ethiopia to help with development work centered around job creation and capacity development with vulnerable women.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they were on the ground in Ethiopia, they quickly learned that Addis Ababa’s central market is the site of numerous brothels, where girls as young as 8 are exploited into prostitution. &lt;br /&gt;
Ian + Brittany began partnering with Women at Risk, an organization that helps with rehabilitation and job placement opportunities across Ethiopia, so that they could work firsthand with vulnerable women caught up in the commercial sex industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They met Zewditu, who became one of the first women to join the Parker Clay team. Zewditu is in her early 20’s and comes from a farming family just outside of Ethiopia’s capital city, Addis Ababa. When Zewditu was a young girl, her mother passed away and a lot of pressure was placed on her older sister to provide for the family. Her older sister was forced to go to an Arab country to look for work so she could send money back to her family. Afraid that she might have to make a similar choice, Zewditu came to Parker Clay where she was trained to sew and offered a job. She now dreams of getting married and having kids of her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zewditu’s story is one of empowerment and change, where her value and dignity was restored through Parker Clay’s unique mission. While they love sharing the story of individuals behind their products, Parker Clay believes that the story of community is just as significant. Parker Clay has cultivated a unique community of farmers, tanneries, and artisans who are involved at every step of the process until the product ends up in the consumer’s hands. Through the purchase of their unique products, the consumer becomes part of a global community and a larger impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Parker Clay is about showing these women that they see them, they care about them, and they support them. Their advise for aspiring social enterprises?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Be willing to go deep into relationship and be prepared for a messy process that comes with developing relationship. Let your vision guide you and be aware of mission drift. You might start with great intentions, but then find yourself compromising the very purpose and impact you are trying to make. Hold ruthlessly to your vision, even perhaps at cost for short term gain.”&lt;/p&gt;

Focused on a mission to give love and give life, they make cards and products that empower others to love their friends and family well and make an impact on children around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founder + designer Chelcea Cummings tells the story of Love Light Paper, and the bigger purpose behind their cards. 
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always loved giving gifts and spending way, WAY too much time in greeting card sections, trying to pick out the ‘exact perfect card’ for whomever I was buying for. More often than not, I would find myself thinking, “if only I could find a card that had ‘this’ on it,” or “if it only said ‘that’ instead.” LoveLight Paper was born out of of this… my desire to make gift-giving personal and meaningful, rather than just ritual… to Give Love. I started designing cards with specific people in mind, so it could be the perfect card for that specific person. But I wanted these cards to go even beyond that… to Give Life… to sustain life beyond a simple material gift given. I sought out local non-profits that would help fulfill this desire, and found Kids Around The World’s One Meal mission. Through their program, a portion of the proceeds from every item purchase goes to providing a meal to a child in need. It’s a one-for-one style program, but some products give even more than one meal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through their stationary, LoveLight Paper is bridging the gap for every day consumers to be a part of something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chelcea explains that, “Within cards and gifts, people communicate some of their deepest and most meaningful messages to one another… things that otherwise go unsaid on a daily basis. Most of our cards are left blank inside intentionally - so that you as the gift-giver or note-writer can be the one to make it meaningful… to deepen your relationships by loving one another. And as you give that card to someone, how special is it to know that you also just provided a meal for a someone else, somewhere else around the world! It’s a gift that keeps on giving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With running a social enterprise comes an immense amount of reward, but also its fair share of challenges and defeats. Chelcea + her husband, co-founders on a mission together, are fueled knowing that their simple products are able to literally give life and nourishment to children around the world. As consumers are giving these cards to friends and family for celebrations, milestones, and encouragement, an even more basic level of need is being met. Each product bought represents another life being sustained and nourished. It’s a gift that keeps on giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of our featured brands this season at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.ticketleap.com/spread-joy/&quot;&gt;Spread Joy Market&lt;/a&gt;, we invite you to take part in the bigger impact that this company is having!

That I would never understand the true depths of the heart of a mother, the very heartbeat of motherhood, until my body carried, delivered, and nursed a baby of my very flesh-made in love and intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know how to respond. I had just lost two precious children as a foster mom. They were my biological half brothers and my foster sons at the same time, and they were reunified with our birth mom, a devastating decision by the Orange County Juvenile Courts, for me and for them. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were mine to love for two years. I bottle weaned, potty trained, and endured the storm of tantrums for one. I laid on the ground soiled with the tears of meltdowns and helped with math and reading, and sat in parent teacher conferences with another. My body was exhausted all the time. The bags under my eyes felt beyond just an expression of tiredness-I felt them physically weighing me down. My body did not deliver these boys, but my body felt motherhood deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After losing them, my body turned more exhausted, more tired; my mind turned over the events daily, and my bed became a place where I imagined what their new life looked like without our stability and love. I’m not anti-second chances, but I am for the child, not the birth parent, first. Unfortunately, this circumstance favored only the mom who still drank, still hit, still screamed, still left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of our loss, my husband and I found out we were expecting our first. I carried our daughter for nine months and ate all my greens and had the experience of birthing her and nursing her and experiencing the helpless neediness of a newborn babe. She’s forever my girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the birthing, the nursing, and the physical act of carrying her in my womb didn’t replace the loss of the two I carried in my heart. No; if anything, it made the loss all the deeper for those nine months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward some time-we have an eleven month old, are expecting baby number two, and receive an unexpected, but oh-so-hoped-for phone call from Child Protective Services-the situation worsened and it’s time to bring our boys home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two years of not seeing and not hearing from them; not knowing who was tucking them in, or if they even had a bed to be tucked into. Two years of not knowing who was reading them stories or crying with them when life felt too heavy for such a little heart…not being able to comfort or scare away the monsters (both real and imaginary)-they were coming home, maybe this time for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And something interesting has haunted (for lack of a better word) my mind these last six months of having our boys home. We now have a house of seven, three adopted, two birthed, one still nursing, one enjoying her new found favorite word, “no…” and there has never been a moment where I look at one child as more “mine” than the other. My sons are not less ours because we didn’t birth them. They have a background we must fight to understand, yes-But our hearts do not lack a deep love for them because they were not brought home from the hospital with us. Our daughters are not more ours because we experienced the 30 hours in the hospital of laboring and waiting and yearning for them. Yes, that’s an experience to treasure and remember-but so is the anticipation we experienced on our drive to Orangewood to pickup our sons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are different chapters of the same book; different layers of the same love. One does not make me more of a mother than the other. Each child has initiated me into this role of mommy-hood-releasing in me the fire to fight for whatever is needed for one the power to love at any cost for all, and the soft whisper of nurturing that is birthed with becoming Mom-no matter how the title was given.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sally Kim</name></author><category term="adoption" /><category term="motherhood" /><category term="family" /><category term="children" /><category term="birth" /><category term="foster-care" /><summary type="html">When I was engaged, I once had a woman tell me that I would never understand what being a mom meant until I birthed my own child.

Journey through a sea of unknowns, intricate passions, and deep questions. I’ve always been fascinated by people, and I’ve always loved business. Since I was little, I’ve always sought to get understanding at the root, and to be apart of people’s journeys.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within minutes of my conversation with Kalee, I recognize an immense amount of experience, depth, and passion. After graduating from Southern Methodist University as a communications and PR major, Kalee dove right into a career in marketing at a sports entertainment firm. With clients like Puma, ATNT, and other big name companies, Kalee was balancing a lot of responsibility, traveling constantly, and often working 60-80 hour weeks. 
“When you’re working that much and you’re traveling that much, it can also be really lonely and isolating. So I came to this place… if I’m going to be working this much, I should at least be doing something I really care about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking more meaning and purpose in her work meant living through a nine month journey of asking hard questions to find out what her best contribution to the world could be.&lt;br /&gt;
“What are my skills? What are my gifts? What do I like? I didn’t even know, to be honest, and it was really disorienting.” 
Through asking hard questions, allowing people to speak into her life, and a pivotal conversation with her mom, Kalee came to realize she wanted to be a therapist. She didn’t even know what a marriage and family therapist was at the time, but Kalee knew she had experienced a lot of healing in her life, so she wanted to be able to offer that to people.What Kalee was stepping into didn’t make sense at first, and she didn’t have a complete picture of what she was walking into, but isn’t that where the adventure is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing her program and powering through the grind of getting her hours, Kalee launched her own private practice in January of this year. “What I say I will never do, tends to be what I do. This whole journey has been one of open hands, and I’ve really grown. In getting to be in private practice, in in-patient psych, in trauma work, and in getting to see how people’s stories play out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After launching her practice, Kalee knew there was still more - something different, something bigger she needed to step into. Kalee asked, “What are the parts of me that I want to play in? I have this kingdom to play in, where do I say ‘yes’ and where do I say ‘no way?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this whole season, Kalee had always been involved at Wayfare on different levels. “I realized I love business strategy, it excites me. But I also love leaders. I understand the nuances and complexities of being a leader. Whether you’re the CEO for a for-profit, whether you’re the executive director of a non-profit, or you’re leading a church… whatever it is, there are a lot of things that go with that. It can be a very isolating place, and it’s really  hard to live into the fullness of who you are because of the expectation, because of the pressure, because of the burdens. You can’t be fully known, because of the expectations at play.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And out of Kalee’s heart, her background, and her first hand experience in leadership, Wayfare’s Impact Program was born. She began asking the question, “What does it look like to create a space for leaders to be fully human and flourish for themselves, but then also for their relationships and their organizations to flourish?”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Kalee came to Jeff Tanner, co-founder of Wayfare, with this vision, and it catalyzed. She entered Launch, one of Wayfare’s startup programs, and began a 15 week journey to grow the Impact Program from an idea to an organization, to help leaders sustain impact. Kalee’s heart bleeds with the passion to change the culture of work by providing leaders with a space to live in the fullness of who they are and lead their organizations out of that place - instead of a place of isolation, burnout, exhaustion, and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One thing we believe is that a lonely leader won’t sustain impact. If you’re living detached from who you are, then you’re not going to be able to continue leading and impacting well. Your impact may actually become destructive, and you will start to implode. That may be a slow deterioration, or it may be an accelerated deterioration. With that, you also start to see the breakdown in family, the breakdown in an organization, as well as personal breakdown.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing practical and integrated support, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wayfare.io/startups/&quot;&gt;Impact&lt;/a&gt; provides a space for leaders to lead sustainably. Leaders who are apart of the Impact program are placed in locationally based cohorts to meet once a month. Groups are led by a business guide and an integration guide, and participants will engage in discussion on organizational victories, unique challenges, and questions so that they begin to have a bigger picture of what they’re operating out of. The experience is very collaborative, organic, and it’s a very in-process format. Through facilitated conversation, shared meals, and guided self-reflection, the Impact Program is a tool for leaders to be able to invest intentionally in their lives and in their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalee’s mission is that as leaders begin to live into the fullness of who there are, they begin to work in meaning and interact with one another in a way that starts to define the new vocabulary that they’re bringing into their own organization. As they model this in their leadership, their employees will be empowered and start to ask questions and realize that who they are is so incredibly intertwined with the way they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kalee prepares to launch the Impact Program this Thursday at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayfare.ticketleap.com/wayfare-labs-pitch-night/&quot;&gt;Wayfare’s Pitch Night&lt;/a&gt;, she invites people into her vision - to take a step toward sustainable impact for themselves, or encouraging a leader they know to step into it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="work" /><category term="life" /><category term="startups" /><category term="impact" /><summary type="html">“My story has been one marked by journey. Journey through a sea of unknowns, intricate passions, and deep questions. I’ve always been fascinated by people, and I’ve always loved business. Since I was little, I’ve always sought to get understanding at the root, and to be apart of people’s journeys.”

Within minutes of my conversation with Kalee, I recognize an immense amount of experience, depth, and passion. After graduating from Southern Methodist University as a communications and PR major, Kalee dove right into a career in marketing at a sports entertainment firm. With clients like Puma, ATNT, and other big name companies, Kalee was balancing a lot of responsibility, traveling constantly, and often working 60-80 hour weeks. 
“When you’re working that much and you’re traveling that much, it can also be really lonely and isolating. So I came to this place… if I’m going to be working this much, I should at least be doing something I really care about.”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://wayfare.io/uploads/a-journey-toward-impact.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">That Marriages Would Thrive: From Crashing to Connecting</title><link href="http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/11/04/that-marriages-would-thrive-from-crashing-to-connecting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="That Marriages Would Thrive: From Crashing to Connecting" /><published>2016-11-04T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-11-04T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/11/04/that-marriages-would-thrive-from-crashing-to-connecting</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/11/04/that-marriages-would-thrive-from-crashing-to-connecting/">&lt;p&gt;What do you think of when the word marriage comes up? Long flowing white dress? Small house in the suburbs? Two individuals who are devoted to spending the rest of their lives together? &lt;!-- more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Casey and Meygan met each other in college, it was love at first sight. Young and in love, they decided to get married just two years later. The young couple went into their new stage of life full of wonder and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While marriage is a beautiful union, it is not at all what the movies depict it to be. Between both sets of parents, there were 12 marriages. They knew firsthand the troubles, the pain, and the brokenness of marriage. Refusing to let those failed marriages affect their future, Casey and Meygan dove into their marriage headfirst to prove to themselves that marriage can work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That idealized view came crashing down soon enough as their lives became plagued with arguments after arguments. Wasn’t marriage the answer to happiness? Why was it suddenly so difficult to maintain happiness after they said “I do”? They vowed that divorce was not an option, but things seemed so bleak and the first three years of the marriage progressively became worse and worse. They were missing connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not where their story ends. Casey and Meygan knew it was time for a change. But what would help rekindle their marriage? They surrounded themselves with mentors that guided them through this difficult season. They sought to improve and work on themselves before finding fault in the other. They read any book they could get their hands on and attended a marriage boot camp! In many ways, they started dating each other again, discovering what made the other person tick, learning how to communicate better, taking up hobbies together, to back when they were two wide eyed college lovers. They were committed to connecting again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through commitment and connecting, they learned that great marriages don’t just happen by accident. It takes a lot of work, intentionality 365 days a year; thus Marriage365 was born! Casey and Meygan are continually striving to help keep marriages thriving to help out similarly struggling couples, whether that’s through their monthly podcast, online courses, or even being coaches and mentors. They want to see marriages last a lifetime and be a part of the solution. Too often marriage counseling hovers on two extremes; focusing on only family and not the underlying problems or too individualistic, often resulting in divorce. &lt;a href=&quot;http://marriage365.org&quot;&gt;Marriage365&lt;/a&gt; uniquely places itself in the middle, getting down to the raw issues while focusing and family and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their advice for struggling couples? “Many married couples do not want to spend time or money on their marriage until it’s too late. They don’t see the value of regular maintenance with their relationship. The biggest advice we would give is that money, careers, your home, your car all can come and go but your relationships with others is where you’ll find true happiness and contentment. It’s truly how you should measure your success in life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mission is not an easy one; each couple is unique and success looks different for each one.

They are driven to unite north Orange County and provide a place for restorative relationships and life skills training to create empowered lives for OC’s most vulnerable. Founders Jay Williams and Amy Gaw are currently participating in the Launch phase of Wayfare’s &lt;a href=&quot;wayfare.io/startups&quot;&gt;Startup Programs&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve been inspired by them since day one… in the unique way they are pursuing the common good, their humility and solidarity in standing with the vulnerable, and in the way they invite and unite the communities they live and work in. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re all neighbors. We live in the same space and share the same resources. But some of us don’t have homes. Some of us don’t have families. Some of us are isolated despite being surrounded by others. We were tired of feeling helpless when presented with heartbreaking needs, so we decided to do something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org&quot;&gt;OC United&lt;/a&gt; team is made up of a collection of citizens, non-profits and churches that believe they can accomplish more working together than apart. They are based in Christian faith but “welcome anyone with a pulse”. They currently work with the vulnerable in 4 different contexts: those from foster care, those experiencing homelessness, victims of domestic abuse, and families in under-resourced neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of organizations exist to serve vulnerable groups and individuals through various programs and services, but few address the root issue of the problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org&quot;&gt;OC United&lt;/a&gt; believes that people become vulnerable because they are experiencing the breakdown of the family unit. The ramifications of this breakdown are all around us in society, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org&quot;&gt;OC United&lt;/a&gt; seeks to rebuild and restore the family units by loving support and transitional empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe that lasting change occurs by coming alongside the vulnerable in long-term relationship, not through programs alone. As we continue to make strategic decisions, we want to ask ourselves: How are we helping to heal and restore those affected by broken family units?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org&quot;&gt;OC United&lt;/a&gt; serves the vulnerable in a variety of contexts. Some of their programs include &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org/homeless/&quot;&gt;facilitating family fun nights and kids clubs for motel families&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org/homeless/&quot;&gt;mobile laundry and showers for the homeless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org/neighbors/&quot;&gt;after school tutoring and ESL classes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org/homeless/&quot;&gt;empowering homeless with life skills and career building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org/foster-care/&quot;&gt;supporting foster families with errands, childcare, encouragement, &amp;amp; tangible goods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocunited.org/foster-care/&quot;&gt;mentorship&lt;/a&gt;, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are committed to building a strong foundation for the future and sustaining long term impact. Their vision for the future, as a direct result of their mission, is that by June 2017 they will further their impact by working in relationship with 500 individuals/families providing place for connection, support, and empowerment to build into healthy family units.&lt;/p&gt;

Answer yes or no to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I prefer one-on-one conversations to group activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I often prefer to express myself in writing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I dislike small talk, but I enjoy talking in-depth about topics that matter to me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People tell me that I’m a good listener.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I enjoy work that allows me to “dive in” with few interruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I like to celebrate birthdays on a small scale, with only one or only a few friends.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People describe me as “soft-spoken” or “mellow.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I prefer not to show or discuss my work with others until it’s finished.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I dislike conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I do my best work on my own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tend to think before I speak.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I feel drained after being out and about, even if I’ve enjoyed myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I had to choose, I’d prefer a weekend with less to do rather than too much. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were like me and were shaking your head vigorously yes to most of these questions, then congratulations! You are an introvert!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were also like me, then this result would have repulsed you. On almost every one of my report cards, my teachers would write, “Emily needs to come out of her shell.” I recall the first time my mother confronted me about this, gripping the report card in her hand. “Why can’t you be like the other kids? You will not be successful if you are quiet!” These are not words that eight year olds want to hear, or can even comprehend. Even a newly immigrated Chinese woman who barely spoke English knew that there was something “wrong” with being an introvert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this feedback, I felt the need to correct myself and become a “learned extrovert”. I forced myself to raise my hand and talk in class. I forced myself to be the “leader” in group projects. I forced myself to mingle and hang out in large group settings. To the outside world, it might have seemed I was successful. But was I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t realize was that “shy” and “introvert” aren’t necessarily the same thing. &lt;strong&gt;Shyness is the fear of negative judgment, and introversion is a preference for minimally stimulating environments.&lt;/strong&gt; On the contrary,extraverts typically tend to enjoy human interactions and thrive off being around other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21st century Western culture revolves around extroversion. Classrooms are structured so that kids face each other in a table and many office spaces are designed in the same manner, to encourage students and coworkers to talk and work together.. We’ve become a culture of personality, where charisma and magnetism are highly favored traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I tried to jam myself into that extrovert mold, it was like trying to hold water on a flat plate: messy and useless. I’d flop onto my bed at the end of the day, feeling so drained that no amount of sleep would take away the empty feeling. It wasn’t until I read Susan Cain’s insights on introversion that I truly understood my personality type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her book, Quiet, was a game changer in my life. The title itself was so eye catching: Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking. I immediately picked up the book and saw this line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Don’t think of introversion as something that needs to be cured.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d been told my entire life by my parents, teachers, and friends, to “come out of your shell”. Why was this an issue? Why was it a problem that instead of going to someone’s house on a weekend, I preferred to stay at home and read? Why was it a problem that I liked to think and work by myself before group projects? Why did anyone feel like it was necessary that I had to be an “extrovert”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cain argues that introversion is not a problem at all, but can actually be a person’s greatest strength. Everyone has been given different abilities, and it’s just a matter of knowing yourself and putting yourself in the right environments. In fact, there have been a lot of very influential leaders that were introverts: Rosa Parks, Ghandi, and good old honest Abe! Introversion and leadership are not mutually exclusive. Cain brings up the example of Moses; “we don’t ask why God chose as his prophet a stutterer with a public speaking phobia. But we should. The book of Exodus is short on explication, but its stories suggest that introversion plays yin to the yang of extroversion; that the medium is not always the message; and that people followed Moses because his words were thoughtful, not because he spoke them well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introverts are needed everywhere, even in business! It’s not just an extrovert’s stomping grounds anymore. Because of the overwhelming number of extroverts in the business world, Adrian Schumpeter of The Economist argues that this is why more and more companies need the reflective and long term qualities of an introvert. We need more Mark Zuckerbergs and Bill Gates in a world filled with Steve Jobs and Sheryl Sandbergs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I embrace my introversion, I realize that some of my core strengths come from my introverted personality. My best work comes from my introspection. Creativity flows my from reflection. I strive to be the best version of myself, not a flimsy mold of what society deems is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This by no means is a simple task, and it’s still something I struggle with everyday. But with Cain’s “Quiet Revolution Manifesto”, I’m constantly being reminded that my introversion itself is a strength:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a word for “people who are in their heads too much”— thinkers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solitude is a catalyst for innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next generation of quiet kids can and must be raised to know their own strengths.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes it helps to be a pretend-extrovert. There is always time to be quiet later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But in the long run, staying true to your temperament is the key to finding work you love and work that matters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One genuine relationship is worth a fistful of business cards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s okay to cross the street to avoid making small talk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Quiet leadership” is not an oxymoron.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love is essential; gregariousness is optional.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“In a gentle way, you can shake the world.” —Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take pride in your personality, introverted or extroverted, because you have the power to change the world as long as you are passionate. It may manifest itself in different ways but the potential is not restricted to how you enjoy your free time. As Susan Cain beautifully states, “we know from myths and fairy tales that there are many different kinds of powers in this world. One child is given a light saber, another a wizard’s education. The trick is not to amass all the different kinds of power, but to use well the kind you’ve been granted.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="introversion" /><category term="introvert" /><category term="personality" /><category term="quiet" /><category term="susan" /><category term="cain" /><category term="shy" /><category term="western" /><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">Let’s take a quiz!

Sweatshops, prostitute rings, and domestic work are a few examples of the enslavement of men, women and even children. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm&quot;&gt;International Labour Organization&lt;/a&gt;, around 21 million individuals are forced into slavery each year around the world, and the impact of slavery is evident in nearly every aspect of our lives. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Slaves harvest cocoa in West Africa, and it ends up in our chocolate. Slaves make charcoal in Brazil, which is used to run smelters that make steel for our cars. Many food products and raw materials are tainted by slavery—such as tomatoes, tuna, shrimp, cotton, diamonds, iron, sugar, and gold.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freetheslaves.net&quot;&gt;Free The Slaves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing an end to modern-day slavery is a fight that isn’t over, and we stand with the warriors around the world fighting on the frontline for complete redemption and freedom for all people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many incredible organizations that is committed to ending modern slavery is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purposejewelry.org&quot;&gt;Purpose Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org&quot;&gt;iSanctuary’s&lt;/a&gt; social enterprise. They are dedicated to helping every single woman they can, by giving her a second chance at life. 100% of their jewelry proceeds benefit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org&quot;&gt;International Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, their parent non-profit organization, which provides holistic care for young women rescued from sex trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among many other world-changing social enterprises, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purposejewelry.org&quot;&gt;Purpose Jewelry&lt;/a&gt; provides everyday opportunities for consumers like you and I to directly empower women in need worldwide. By buying a piece of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purposejewelry.org&quot;&gt;Purpose Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, you directly affect the life of a young survivor of sex trafficking across the world in six specific ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medical &amp;amp; Dental Care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org&quot;&gt;iSanctuary&lt;/a&gt; provides much needed medical and dental care to the women rescued from sex trafficking. This care can be for something as minor as a check-up to life-saving procedures. By buying a necklace, you could very well save someone’s life and help her stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org&quot;&gt;iSanctuary&lt;/a&gt; has started an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org/academy/&quot;&gt;Academy program&lt;/a&gt;, which provides every young woman in the program with opportunities to dream of a sustainable future by setting educational and personal development goals in four core areas, while earning an income. Many girls who escape or are rescued from modern-day slavery are hindered by their lack of education and employable skills. By buying a piece of jewelry and thus giving these girls and women an education, you are opening up doors to a better future and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scholarships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing education to the women they work with, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org&quot;&gt;iSanctuary&lt;/a&gt; also provides scholarships. With these scholarships, the women are given the opportunity to further their education, either through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org/academy/&quot;&gt;The Academy&lt;/a&gt; or to attend university. These scholarships are funded by your purchases from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purposejewelry.org&quot;&gt;Purpose Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Counseling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After experiencing the horrors of modern-day slavery and the sex trade, a woman needs a safe space to work through her experiences and feelings. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org&quot;&gt;iSanctuary&lt;/a&gt; provides support and counseling, helping the women heal. In addition to counseling, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org&quot;&gt;iSanctuary&lt;/a&gt; provides one-on-one mentoring and life skills training so women can confidently get back on their feet and regain independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Micro-loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To regain independence, it is crucial that the survivors of modern-day slavery have basic financial skills and can financially support themselves. When necessary, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isanctuary.org&quot;&gt;iSanctuary&lt;/a&gt; provides loans to the young women who need them. At the same time, the women are taught financial skills and are helped in opening their own bank account so that they can be financially stable and independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stability and routine is very important to a woman overcoming the trauma of modern-day slavery, and employment provides this stability. Through working for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purposejewelry.org&quot;&gt;Purpose Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, these survivors receive job training and paychecks. As a result, they don’t have to worry about job searches or finances, and they can focus on their healing.&lt;/p&gt;

Sweatshops, prostitute rings, and domestic work are a few examples of the enslavement of men, women and even children. According to the International Labour Organization, around 21 million individuals are forced into slavery each year around the world, and the impact of slavery is evident in nearly every aspect of our lives.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://wayfare.io/uploads/buy-jewelry-change-lives.JPG" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Seeing People Who Feel Invisible</title><link href="http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/10/04/seeing-people-who-feel-invisible/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Seeing People Who Feel Invisible" /><published>2016-10-04T16:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-10-04T16:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/10/04/seeing-people-who-feel-invisible</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://wayfare.io/stories/2016/10/04/seeing-people-who-feel-invisible/">&lt;p&gt;“His scream was ear-splitting. The stairwell in our apartment building acted as an amplifier, his cry blatantly bouncing of our building’s walls. My wife and I shamelessly named him “the screaming homeless man”.
There was one afternoon when his scream traveled upstairs and found its home in our living room as I was sitting on my couch reading this book about love - Love Does. The book was talking about loving your neighbor, and it hit me: he was my neighbor. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I went down to talk to him for the first time. His name was Matt. In that moment of speaking with him I had this overwhelming sense that I needed to paint his portrait. He had such an interesting face. This big beard. You could see the struggle on Matt’s face, and I saw beauty in it.
I hadn’t painted in eight years, but I envisioned his story coming alive on the canvas in cool blues and deep yellows. From Matt’s story of ambition, failure, and isolation, &lt;strong&gt;The Faces of Santa Ana&lt;/strong&gt; was born. I call it a family before anything, because that’s what it’s become. I meet them, I build trust, I paint them, and they become family. We have imperfect relationships, there are hard moments. There are easy moments. There are great moments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Peterson, founder of the Faces of Santa Ana, studied car design at the Cleveland Institute of Art, and currently works at KIA design center. As I listened to Brian relay Matt’s story, I can tell he’s living out of an unbridled passion to make the invisible seen. In Brian’s case, his medium of choice is oil on canvas, and his process is unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The painting starts the minute I say hello, before I even buy the canvas. Sometimes, when I meet them I already know what color it’s going to be. I met a lady the other day and I told her, “Red. I have to paint you with Red.” Only after learning their stories can I go home and paint. The painting embodies who they are. Their experiences. I take all of that with me when I go home to paint in my living room. I want what’s coming onto the canvas to be them. Each painting takes between 12 and 16 hours, and then I take it out to them in the streets wherever they may be sleeping, living, or standing. Then they get to sign the painting. That’s important, because I want them to know that they’re part of this story. You can tell some of them forget how to sign their signature. These are people who have been outcast by their families, by society, by everyone that walks by - when I follow through and show them the finished product, trust is built.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a year since his encounter with Matt, and Brian is on his fifteenth FOSA painting, each 30x40inch masterpiece being sold at an average of $2,500. The money from the purchase goes to meet a direct need of the person featured in the painting. How does Brian decide which need to meet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I usually ask them. Along the way I’ve learned a lot, but I want to know their hopes and dreams, I want to know the things that are keeping them in the chains that they’re experiencing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Faces of Santa Ana, Brian had never sold a painting. His art was always a selfless expression of love towards people he cared about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I gave a piece of art to the financial director at my college, and I gave a bunch of my paintings in college to my friends. I never thought of it as a way to make money, so this is new for me. If you go to my father’s house… his house is all full of my paintings. If I love someone, I give them a painting. I think we all have a unique way to show people love, we all have that capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re all born with the capacity to love someone. What’s your medium?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
