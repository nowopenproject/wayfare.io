## Coworking FAQ

##### What are your open coworking hours?

Both Wayfare locations are open for coworking Monday-Friday from 9am to 5pm. Wayfare members receive exclusive access to extended hours (24/7 for dedicated desk & office members and 7am to 7pm for all other price plans — barring any special events).

##### Can I work at Wayfare on the weekends?

Wayfare is closed on the weekends for coworking, but dedicated members have keys to access their offices on the weekends.

Occasionally we host fun weekend events and we’d love for you to join us! Subscribe to our newsletter to join the Wayfare community & get to know others in your city.

##### Can I bring friends, team members, or clients to work alongside me?

_Of course!_ We love new friends. If your guest is here for a meeting in a meeting room, there is no charge for them outside of the rate of the room. If you’d like them to cowork with you in the main space, we ask that you (or your guest) purchase a time pass. Unlike most coworking spaces that require visitors to buy full day passes, we also have flexible options for two hour ($15) and half day ($25) passes. _Score!_


\* Drop-in rates vary by location. To view yours, visit your [location's](/locations) rates page.

##### How fast is your internet?

Costa Mesa: 300/30Mb (shared coax)  
Fullerton: 100/100Mb (shared fiber)

In case you aren't up to speed (see what we did there) on what this means, in layman's terms, the internet speed is fast! Our members find it very sufficient for their needs from checking email to streaming video. Obviously nothing is flawless, but if there is ever a problem (which is rare), we strive to fix it as quickly as possible.

##### Do coworking packages come with discounts on meeting rooms?

_Yes!_ All Wayfare memberships come with tiered meeting room discounts to use on meeting rooms each month.

##### How do meeting room bookings work?

We have several options for reservable meeting rooms so you can have the space and privacy you need for team & client meetings, strategy sessions, or if you just need some quality alone time with the whiteboard. All meeting rooms can be booked by members online via our member portal, and the rooms are first come first served. If you aren’t a member and would like to book a meeting room, please [contact us](https://wayfare.typeform.com/to/vn3h2H).

##### My coworking plan is “x” hours a month. How are those hours tracked?

When you access WiFi for the first time you'll log in with your username and password. After that your computer will automatically check you in and out each day and track your hours. Pretty great, huh?

##### I talk on the phone a lot. What’s your policy on phone calls?

If you talk on the phone in a normal talking voice, you're more than welcome to take phone calls in the main space as long as you're respectful of those working quietly around you. If you're a screamer, we ask that you take your phone calls outside or in our phone booth.

##### Do you have printing and scanning?

_Yes!_ We have printing and scanning at both locations. Our scanners sync with the iPhone and will allow you to save, text, or email your scans as a PDF.

##### Is coffee included?

_Of course!_ We believe coffee is fundamental to world change. Every morning there will be freshly brewed drip coffee available for members. If you work out of our Costa Mesa location, your desk will also be footsteps away from the best coffee shop in town, [Neat Coffee](http://www.neat.coffee)!

##### Can I bring my dog?

It hurts us to say this, but unfortunately we do not allow dogs at Wayfare. While most of us here are total dog-lovers, we are a growing community of humans...and more humans means more dogs. While this seems like a dream to some, it doesn't always make for a productive coworking environment. So please leave your dogs at home and show us your puppy photos often.

##### Is there parking, and does it cost extra?

We have plenty of parking at both locations, and yes---it’s free! Wayfare Costa Mesa has a large parking lot right out front, and our Fullerton location is seated right next to a parking garage with free timed parking.
