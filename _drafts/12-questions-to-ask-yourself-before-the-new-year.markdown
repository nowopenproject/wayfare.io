This year, my husband and I created a New Year’s bucket list of all the things we wanted to do in 2016. The list included things like: ride a motorcycle through Vietnam, hike the narrows at Zion National Park, attend the RISE festival, and finally take up a ceramics class. And a graphic design class. And sewing (because why not?!).

The list was posted on our refrigerator throughout the entire year, and I looked straight into it every time I opened the door. The things on the list were inspiring and wonderful… and completely unachievable. Our plates were full.<!-- more -->

Every morning (after gazing at our untouched bucket list), we left the house for full days. We spent each weekday working full time jobs (that we love), giving 110% of ourselves daily to our work. For my husband, that often meant working through the night as an EMT while being a full time student and a volunteer firefighter. We took on new projects and learned new skills, learned a lot about humility, service, and how to say “no”, and we invested, celebrated, and mourned with our friends.  

I look forward to the day we can cross “ride a motorcycle through Vietnam” off the list, but I do not mourn the remains of this year’s resolutions. This year, I celebrate the unexpected joys and trials that have taught character and grit. I celebrate what I’ve learned about my priorities as well as my capacity. I celebrate that saying “no” to instagram-worthy New Year’s resolution items left essential white space for personal growth and reflection, the response to pain, the creation of meaningful work, and most importantly, deeper relationships. 

I’m encouraged by fellow Wayfarers that have taught me to re-frame the definition and pursuit of adventure. I love checking out after a long week & exploring a new National Park just as much as the next person — but I’ve learned that showing up to our daily lives and rejoicing in the gift of each day, trailblazing through hardship with tenacity, and sharing & embracing our messy stories with those we journey through life with is often the biggest adventure we can embark on — and can be life changing for ourselves and those around us.

As the new year approaches, I encourage you to set New Year’s resolutions for yourself that embrace this kind of adventure. Start small. Spend more time in conversations that matter. Give yourself grace. Take more evening walks. Start each morning with a prayer of peace and gratitude. Seek more counsel from people you admire.  Turn off your phone.  Invite strangers in for dinner.

As you move forward into the New Year and consider your own resolutions, I encourage you to pause and reflect on the previous year. Asking yourself important reflection questions can be a great way to ensure the goals you are setting are relevant, based on your priorities, and rooted in gratitude. Here are twelve questions to use as a starting point to reflect & take a moment to honor the triumphs, mourn the losses, celebrate your growth:

1. What was my greatest contribution this year?
(What did I do right? What do I feel that I have done especially well?)

2. What was an unexpected joy this year?

3. What was an unexpected obstacle? What were my biggest challenges/difficulties? How did I grow from them? 

4. In what way(s) did I grow emotionally?

5. In what way(s) did I grow spiritually?

6. In what way(s) did I grow physically?

7. What are the three most important things I learned this year?

8. What did I complete or release? What still feels incomplete to me?

9. What was the most enjoyable part of my work?

10. What was the most challenging part of my work?

11. What do I want/need to incorporate more of into my daily life? 

12. For what am I particularly grateful?


You got this! Here’s to a New Year of lives well lived for the things that matter most.
