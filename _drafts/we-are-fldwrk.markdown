Wayfare to FLDWRK (Blog, Letter to the masses) 

So it has happened. Wayfare is officially FLDWRK. We had a party to announce the new name and loved having so many people celebrate with us in both the [Fullerton](https://wayfare.io/workspaces/fullerton/) and [Costa Mesa](https://wayfare.io/workspaces/costa-mesa/) spaces.

In case your weren't able to join us, we'd like to fill you in on the news and give you some info about our the new name. So let's jump right in.

We originally chose the name Wayfare because it means the act of journeying and provisions for the journey. We believe everyone is on a journey, and our goal was (and still is) to provide people the provisions they need to do their best work -- work for the world’s best future. While changing our name wasn’t something we initially wanted to do, as we’ve gone through the process of this name change, we’ve realized something surprising. 

When we first started out on this endeavor to help support people in world changing work, we didn’t exactly know what it would look like, but we knew that it was a journey we wanted to take. Over the last couple of years, while engaging with the our community, we've gained more clarity about their unique experiences and what we can offer in order to best serve them. By immersing ourselves in the world of coworking, startups, and social enterprise we've gotten to know so many people within various fields of work and in our communities that are doing amazing things. In getting to know them, we've gained more of an understanding about how we can support them. We've found that you can either get to know about something by reading and theorizing about it, and this is good in a lot of ways. However, the most effective way to learn about something is by directly observing it and immersing yourself in it as much as possible. 

When we started Wayfare, we spent a lot of time ideating about what it would look like, and now that we’ve been immersed in it, we have a better understanding of what it actually looks like. 

From the day we starting thinking about what this idea of an incubator for the world’s best future would look like, we always had in the back of our minds that it would be an adventure, more specifically an adventure for the common good. People are on various journeys and it is really about a process. And when you are pursuing the common good, it naturally implies community. At its core, the common good is the most good for all people, especially the most vulnerable in a society or a community. So there is definitely a community element in this adventure. A journey and adventure toward the common good together. Sharing provisions and resources to move toward a common goal. Wayfare as a name captured this for us. 

You don’t automatically achieve the common good and arrive at your destination…it is an ongoing journey. When you get to one part, you can celebrate where you have been, and you can always look on to see what more can be explored. And that journey is better with people. We view this name change in a similar way. It has been and will continue to be a journey for us… one that we wanted to take with others… specifically the community of people that we’ve been adventuring alongside, so we invited our community to take part in helping us. 

We started a contest asking our members, staff, greater network of friends and advisors to suggest names. And boy did they deliver. We still wanted an action oriented name. One that continued the nod toward grit and adventure. We sought a name that encompassed the physical locations of our workspaces and also the work done in our startup programs.  Amongst many of the names were words that brought forth images of nature, adventure, growth, and directions. Rivers, journeys, compasses, camps, oceans, trees, plants, spaces, pursuing. Our staff voted on our favorites and a name won. But then we found out there was too much competition in the marketplace. We went back to the drawing board. And another name surfaced, but some some good points were brought up as to why it wouldn’t be a good fit. So, we took a step back and looked at the collective whole of submissions. One thing that really stuck out to us was the geographic theme and the theme of the physical spaces. It got our wheels turning and we found that “field” stuck out to us. We talk a lot about being patient gardeners, not frantic salespeople. In a metaphorical sense, we want to cultivate an environment and a culture of work where seeds are planted, they germinate and grow, and then after time, they bear healthy fruit. We don’t want to churn out fly-by-night success stories, but instead want to contribute toward a cultural shift where work is viewed as an act of creating goodness and beauty, where the most simple acts of creating can be viewed alongside the biggest agents of change and are valued as contributions to a collective whole. We want to meet real needs of real people, experiencing real challenges, and we want to partner with them out in the world. One of the key things that we’ve found can make or break any endeavor is knowing the needs of the people who will use your product, program, or service. And that’s when it hit us: “fieldwork”

In short, we’ve been doing fieldwork. The reason for this name choice is threefold. Fieldwork is an anthropological term that means the act of gaining practical experience and knowledge through firsthand observation and the gathering of data through interviewing and observation of subjects in the field. So as we’ve journeyed for these first few years and through this name change, we’ve decided to move forward giving homage to our journey and what it has entailed thus far, Wayfare is now FLDWRK (Fieldwork). It is what we will continue to do and what we encourage our startup program and workspace  members to do--be immersed, observe, and interview people as a means to get to know the root of the problems and the experiences of those who encounter them. It is only then that we can create solutions, implement them effectively, and serve others well.

Additionally, everyone, no matter who they are, is engaged in a field of work. It could be in the medical field, in art, the field of education, the non-profit field, the mission field, the tech field, or in finance. And on and on. You get the idea. We’re believers that no matter where you are, or what you do for work, when you can use the gifts and talents and experiences you have to bring about the world’s best future, you are a creator. Therefore, in your field of work, and even in your life, you can change the world. 

Also, we have the metaphor of planting something, nurturing it and providing the conditions necessary to allow it to grow. There are times where we plant seeds, water them, feed them, till the soil, cultivate the land, prune, and, in time, harvest the fruit. There are also times when we allow our fields to lie fallow and rest so that they may be reenergized and bring forth more life. These are all important parts of stepping into world-changing work as well. 

FLDWRK resonates with us all in different ways. It empowers people to be creators of goodness in any field of work. It inspires the cultivation of an environment where things can grow and bear healthy fruit. It demands that we’re amongst people experiencing real life, seeking to understand, and then taking purposeful action. Whatever way it resonates with you, we invite you to be a part of it. The work is ongoing, so let’s do FLDWRK together. 

We’ve decided to spell it without vowels for a number of reasons…..

The Branding, Spelling, and Logo Talking Points
In the spelling of the name and in the branding, we’ve chosen to leave out the vowels for a few reasons. 

1. To visually represent the necessity to deconstruct how things are typically done and how we strive to look at things differently to create a new way.

2. No endeavor can ever be perfectly executed or fully complete. We need to reassess frequently and leave room to add new elements (or take them away) should they be necessary. It is always an ongoing work with missing parts and moving parts. 

3. Doing something is better than doing nothing, even when (or especially when) it isn't perfect. We cannot do it all, but we can do something and we need to start somewhere. 

4. To give people pause and visually represent the importance of looking at things in a new way. It is identifiable, but still different enough that it makes people take a second look.
