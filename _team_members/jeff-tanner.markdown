**On the weekend you can catch Jeff:** saying good morning to the morning (along with every tree, flower, bird, and bug) in backyard walks with his daughters and pups, catching up on premier league football (aka soccer), or perfecting his grilling skills.

**Be sure to ask Jeff about:** Wabi-sabi, the time he almost died in Thailand, how he saved lives by singing a popular television jingle to a bear, or the time he collected dozens of Christmas trees to build the most epic of winter forts.
