## Frequently Asked Questions

##### Do you offer non-profit discounts?

_Yes!_ There's not much we love more than partnering with incredible non-profits to bring their mission to life in the form of fundraiser events, trainings, meetings, retreats, and more!

We partner with a few select non-profits a year, with whom we offer maximum support and generous pricing that works with their unique needs and budget. Please fill out the [application for special pricing](https://wayfare.typeform.com/to/XTHGhD) to be considered.

##### Can I host an event or meeting during the day on a weekday?

Because we are also a coworking space, we do not host events within the Monday-Friday 9-5 window. In addition, the earliest we can allow setup access for evening events is 5pm.

##### What is your alcohol policy?

If you plan to serve alcohol at your event, we require you to use our bartender (at an additional fee). Along with this, Host Liquor Liability Coverage must be included in your insurance policy.

##### What is your catering policy?

We find that for our venue, outdoor food trucks work best. You are welcome to bring in whatever caterer you prefer or bring in your own snack platters, desserts, etc.

Some of our favorite caterers are [Monarch Social](http://www.monarch-social.com/) and [24 Carrots](http://24carrots.com/). Their food is incredible and they are ideal to work with. However, feel free to use any others that you may prefer!

##### Do I need event insurance? Where do I get it?

_Yes!_ We require everyone to purchase [Special Event Liability Insurance](https://www.theeventhelper.com/#uHX7lU). If alcohol is to be served please make sure that the policy includes Host Liquor Liability Coverage. We made it super easy for you---if you use our [Event Helper](https://www.theeventhelper.com/#uHX7lU) link, it has everything that we require you to have. You just have to enter your information, pay and send it to us.

##### Is furniture is included in the event rental?

Select furniture is available for use at your event.

##### Do you have a kitchen?

_Yes._ You will have access to use our homestyle kitchen, sink, and refrigerator, but please be aware that our kitchen is made for final food prep only, not for food preparations.

##### What is your cleaning policy?

After each event we have our wonderful cleaners make the space look good as new! It is your responsibility to have everything out of space by the exit time you have been given so that our cleaners can come.

##### Do you offer event planning services?

For every potential event, we offer one half hour of complimentary services to answer any questions and do walk-throughs of the space. Once your event is booked we offer 1-hour of additional complimentary services prior to the event to answer any space related questions, develop a space layout plan to best suit your needs, and do a final walkthrough of the space prior to your event. We have found that this is plenty of time to cover the basic questions you may have in regards to the space and how your event will run. As part of this complimentary service, we are happy to include information about what has worked well for past events.

Should you desire more time in planning your event or for us to provide additional services in the form of consultations on run-of-program, decorations, procurement of rentals, staffing, or day of coordination, we are happy to provide those services for an additional fee depending on your specific needs.

Should your event require more than we are able to offer, we have a large network of trusted event planners, designers & coordinators that we are happy to provide referrals to upon request.
