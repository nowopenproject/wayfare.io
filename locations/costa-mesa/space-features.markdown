## Space Features

We don't sacrifice quality around here. From the chairs you sit in to our free, bottomless drip coffee, we've made sure to give you nothing short of the very best.

1. Quality, thoughtful design.
Lit by wide open skylights, brushed with neutral earth tones, and decked with intentional detail, Costa Mesa HQ falls somewhere between warehouse chic and simple elegance. Designed to limit distraction and encourage collaboration, we've curated this space to be a perfect fit for the young, motivated startup, the experienced CEO, and everyone in between.
2. Beautiful meeting spaces
Depending on the nature of your meeting, we offer a variety of options including our large conference room, small conference room, and two semi-private alcoves. Each space comes fully outfitted with a large whiteboard, a monitor for visual presentations, built-in charging ports at each table, comfortable lighting, and chairs that will make those longer, drawn out meetings seamless. All meeting rooms are available to both members and non-members on a first-come, first-serve online booking basis.
3. Handcrafted Desks with USB &amp; Power Ports
Our space features custom desks made locally in Costa Mesa. Hand crafted out of solid walnut, each desk is designed to allow you to spread out, buckle down, and feel at home in your space. Each desk conveniently includes built-in USB and power ports.
4. Ergonomic Chairs
Our space offers Steelcase, top of the line, ergonomic chairs at each co-working desk. Picked with those long, mid-week work days in mind, these chairs are designed with a wide range of adjustments and full support for any build.
5. Coffee. Good coffee.
Members enjoy free Stumptown drip coffee all day, no big deal. And if that's not enough, we have an on-site coffee pop-up! Founded by a Costa Mesa local, NEAT Coffee provides a space for you to gather with clients or friends around top notch coffee. With a simple menu of espresso drinks and single origin coffees as well as seasonal specialties with house made syrups, NEAT fuels your work day like no-other.
6. Community Events
As a member, your perks extend beyond the work place and into the Costa Mesa community. You will have free access to member-exclusive events like Forum where you will learn from social good pioneers right here at our HQ location. Members also enjoy discounts on select, ticketed HQ events and workshops.**
7. Shared Resources
Enjoy all the amenities of Staples right in your backyard. Each member has access to free office supplies, free scanning, and ten free pages of printing per day, with the option to purchase more. Stamps, envelopes, and snacks are also available for purchase. Our community kitchen, dining area, and living room style lounges allow you to pause, breathe, and eat in good company.
8. Parking
Our parking is free and there's plenty of it. It's that simple.
9. Lockers
Need extra space to store your stuff? We offer drop-cam monitored lockers for an additional $40/month.
10. Optional Mail Service
Skip the clutter at home and have your work-mail delivered directly to Wayfare! Mail is collected and sorted daily into our mail locker, so that you can store and pick up at your convenience.
