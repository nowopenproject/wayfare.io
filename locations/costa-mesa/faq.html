<h2 class="p-b-1">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h5>Do you host weddings?</h5>
<p>We, unfortunately, do not host wedding receptions or ceremonies in Costa Mesa. We are opening a venue in Fullerton, CA that will be perfect for hosting weddings and receptions.</p>
<p>However, we are open to hosting wedding related events such as rehearsal dinners or bridal showers.</p>

<h5>Do you offer non-profit discounts?</h5>
<p><em>Yes!</em> There's not much we love more than partnering with incredible non-profits to bring their mission to life in the form of fundraiser events, trainings, meetings, retreats, and more!</p>
<p>We partner with a few select non-profits a year, with whom we offer maximum support and generous pricing that works with their unique needs and budget. Please fill out the <a href="https://wayfare.typeform.com/to/XTHGhD">application for special pricing</a> to be considered.</p>

<h5>Can I host an event or meeting during the day on a weekday?</h5>
<p>Because we are also a coworking space, we do not host events within the Monday-Friday, 9am to 5pm window. In addition, the earliest we can allow setup access for evening events is 5pm.</p>

<h5>What is your alcohol policy?</h5>
<p>If you plan to serve alcohol at your event, we require you to use our bartender (at an additional fee). Along with this, Host Liquor Liability Coverage must be included in your insurance policy.</p>

<h5>What is your catering policy?</h5>
<p>We find that, for our venue, outdoor food trucks work best. You are welcome to bring in whatever caterer you prefer or bring in your own snack platters, desserts, etc.</p>
<p>Some of our favorite caterers are <a href="http://www.monarch-social.com/">Monarch Social</a> and <a href="http://24carrots.com/">24 Carrots</a>. Their food is incredible and they are ideal to work with. However, feel free to use any others that you may prefer!</p>

<h5>Do I need event insurance? Where do I get it?</h5>
<p><em>Yes!</em> We require everyone to purchase <a href="https://www.theeventhelper.com/#uHX7lU">Special Event Liability Insurance</a>. If alcohol is to be served please make sure that the policy includes Host Liquor Liability Coverage. We made it super easy for you &#8212; if you use our <a href="https://www.theeventhelper.com/#uHX7lU">Event Helper</a> link, it has everything that we require you to have. You just have to enter your information, pay, and send it to us.</p>

<h5>Is furniture is included in the event rental?</h5>
<p>We have 24 large wooden desks that are great for banquet tables! We just ask that you cover them with plastic table covering and then put linens over them. We also have two beautiful (and comfortable) soft-seated lounge areas (one in the front of the space and one in the back). Along with this, Wayfare has a handful of white, rolling desks that can be used for decorations, food, etc. Chairs are included for certain events.</p>

<h5>Will Neat Coffee be open at my event?</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.neat.coffee/">Neat Coffee</a> is open on Monday-Friday from 7am to 4pm, and the 1st Saturday of each month from 9am to 3pm. If your event falls within Neat's open hours, you will most certainly have access to purchase from the shop! If your event does not fall within Neat's usual open hours and would like to inquire about hiring Neat for your event, please <a href="/locations/costa-mesa/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<h5>Do you have a kitchen?</h5>
<p><em>Yes.</em> You will have access to use our homestyle kitchen, sink, and refrigerator, but please be aware that our kitchen is made for final food prep only, not for food preparations.</p>

<h5>Can I play music at my event?</h5>
<p><em>Yes, we encourage it!</em> We have a fully equipped sound system that you can either use your own playlist or bring in a DJ/band. Loud music must end by 10pm during weeknights (Monday through Thursday) and by midnight on weekends (Friday and Saturday). Additional time can easily be added provided the volume is modest and it cannot be heard beyond the boundaries of the property or by immediate neighbors.</p>

<h5>Are microphone(s) included in the event rental?</h5>
<p>We have one microphone and stand that you are welcome to use. Please give us advanced notice if you'd like to use it.</p>

<h5>Can I play a presentation or a video?</h5>
<p><em>Absolutely!</em> We have a large 80" mounted TV centered on the back wall of the space as well as two 80" rolling televisions. All of our TV's are configured with Apple TV/Airplay &amp; HDMI cord capabilities.</p>

<h5>What is your cleaning policy?</h5>
<p>After each event we have our wonderful cleaners make the space look good as new! It is your responsibility to have everything out of space by the exit time you have been given so that our cleaners can come.</p>

<h5>Do you offer event planning services?</h5>
<p>For every potential event, we offer one half hour of complimentary services to answer any questions and do walk-throughs of the space. Once your event is booked we offer 1 hour of additional complimentary services prior to the event to answer any space related questions, develop a space layout plan to best suit your needs, and do a final walkthrough of the space prior to your event. We have found that this is plenty of time to cover the basic questions you may have in regards to the space and how your event will run. As part of this complimentary service, we are happy to include information about what has worked well for past events.</p>
<p>Should you desire more time in planning your event or for us to provide additional services in the form of consultations on run-of-program, decorations, procurement of rentals, staffing, or day of coordination, we are happy to provide those services for an additional fee depending on your specific needs.</p>
<p>Should your event require more than we are able to offer, we have a large network of trusted event planners, designers, &amp; coordinators that we are happy to provide referrals to upon request.</p>
