#####**Mentorship: Young Adults and Recent Grads**

So, you're in your senior year of college.  Or perhaps you've recently graduated. Congratulations! Now what? If you find yourself not really knowing what's next, here are a few options for you:

1. Wander aimlessly.
2. Keep going to school...and rack up more debt trying to figure out what to do.
3. Start the job search for something you *think* you *might* be a good fit.  
4. Seek guidance from people who have been there and are passionate about helping you find the best fit for your life. A.K.A. Get a mentor. 

<!-- more --> 

We vote for option 4 because sometimes it fits to *be* a mentor, other times, it fits to be *mentored*. We'd like to introduce you to [The Integrated](http://www.theintegrated.life). 

[The Integrated](http://www.theintegrated.life) is a program developed by people who want to come along side you as you figure things out so you don't wander aimlessly for the foreseeable future.  The founder, [Jonathan](http://www.theintegrated.life/about.html), and his co-founder, [Ariel](http://www.theintegrated.life/about.html),  are [FLDWRK coworking](fldwrk.io/workspace) members and our [startup incubator](https://fldwrk.io/startups) participants so we know them well.  They are the real deal and they are starting this program because they want to help address the needs of emerging adults as they transition into life. 

From personal experience they realized a need for a formative transition program that offers more than just practical solutions (professional & financial) for life. It is during this crucial stage in life that a strong foundation is laid. Any transition from one thing to another is challenging, however the transition from school to the realities of life is especially difficult. It is comparable to culture shock in that it can be personally disorienting to transition into an unfamiliar way of life. After finishing school or receiving a degree, it may seem as though you should know exactly how to navigate life, but many individuals wander for years as they try to balance their life. 

Participating in a program that helps you make this transition easier is a no-brainer. Find out more about [The Integrated](http://www.theintegrated.life) and how to [support](https://grouprev.com/theintegrated) this awesome start-up.
