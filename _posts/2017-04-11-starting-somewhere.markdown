Everyone starts somewhere, right? I had just graduated college and was ready for a new adventure. Having fallen in love with the city during previous travels, I thought, "Why not London?" I packed my bags and took off for a three-month internship across the pond. However, upon landing, I immediately asked myself, "What am I doing here?" In all my travel experience, I had never felt homesick before. But rather than letting myself drown in loneliness, I chose to be intentional about connecting with the people I missed back in Orange County by starting an online magazine so that my friends and I could process this life transition together. <!-- more -->

I started Skyping with a good friend, Jane (whom I lovingly refer to as my “co” because she basically saved my life when it came to building a website and creating an online presence). We picked a website theme, created an Instagram account, and called up all of our recently-graduated friends to ask them how they were processing life after college. After convincing them to write it all down, we released the very first issue of [Whilst](http://whilstmagazine.com) magazine.

Whilst (besides being obnoxiously English) is the word that resides right in the middle of a sentence, the place most people don’t dwell in because they want to get back to the action. It signifies transition—whilst traveling, whilst working, whilst sipping your tea: it’s the word that moves us from the present to the action. That is what we’re about—we want to act as a catalyst for present thinking, to encourage individuals to mindfully enter into their own process and learn the practice of empathizing with others on the same journey.

I knew I wanted to take Whilst farther, to really dive into what the magazine stood for and how I could create a career out of this growing passion. I frequently found myself on the [FLDWRK website](https://fldwrk.io), and it was during the [Idea Weekend](https://fldwrk.io/startups/idea-weekend/) that I learned how to articulate what Whilst really is and how it could change lives. That’s when I knew I wanted to be a part of a community that exists to change the world for good and create beauty in whatever life stage we are journeying through. The next step, then, was to continue to press into what my vision was for Whilst—how far could this concept of being present in the midst really go? Through sitting down and talking it out with the FLDWRK coaches and other entrepreneurs, I found my dreams were bigger than I had imagined. I am continuing to develop and refine my leadership skills now as I continue in [FLDWRK's Launch program.](https://fldwrk.io/startups/launch-program/)

It has officially been a year since I took off on a plane and began learning for myself what it means to live in the midst of the process and engage with transition. Whilst Magazine is one year old and we are coming up on our fourth release, [available by subscription](https://www.patreon.com/whilstmagazine) on April 14th! (SO SOON!) I can’t begin to describe how much [Whilst](http://whilstmagazine.com) has grown in the last year, let alone the last few weeks at FLDWRK, and I am so thankful to be here whilst experiencing it all.
