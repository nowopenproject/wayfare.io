If you're on the fence about interning this semester, we say: go for it! Here's why:

1. Life-long relationships This is the sexy version of 'networking' (we hate the word networking). Knowing people significantly boosts your credibility and chances of being hired somewhere. Being intentional about investing in the people around you throughout your internship builds relational equity - something that is invaluable as you begin to pursue a long-term career.

2. A higher starting salary. College graduates who have an internship under heir belt are actually able to compete for higher starting wages. Having gone through an internship program shows your employers that you're one step ahead of the next guy, with relevant experience and solid references to back it up.

3. Academia meets practical experience. An internship offers you a unique opportunity to bridge college and your career. A good internship program will give you real projects & responsibilities so you can take 12+ years of head-knowledge and begin to apply it in a real-world setting.

4. Résumé-building. Let's be honest, most of our college résumés were less than impressive. Part time here, babysitting there... internships add some meat to the bones of your resume. They tell your future employers that you went out of your way to seek experience and assure them that you would add concrete value to their company.

5. Take your career on a test-run. It's like like playing house - you get to try something out without the burden of a long term commitment. You discover your strengths, your weaknesses, what you love about work, and what you can't stand. You learn what type of people you work well with and what type of people you clash with. You find out what gives you life and what drains you. Internships are key to personal and professional development.
