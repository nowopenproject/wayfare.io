excerpt: Nuru's mission is to end extreme poverty in remote, rural areas. Right now
  we have community development projects in Kenya, Ethiopia, and we're expanding to
  a third country next year. I am constantly inspired by my brilliant colleagues,
  our incredible local teams and farmers, and everyone's tireless efforts in achieving
  Nuru's mission. With a mission like this it isn't difficult to stay productive.
  Practically though with two kids at home, I have to utilize every minute of kid-free
  work-time to its fullest (well besides the important time I spend exploring the
  amazing Skype Mojis to ensure I start off my Skype meetings in style).

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

New Zealand, so I can retrace the steps of my ancestors, the Hobbits.

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

I handle all things HR (human resources) at [Nuru](http://www.nuruinternational.org). My role exists to serve our staff and I strive to make working at Nuru awesome. 

I graduated from Concordia University (go Eagles!) and taught high school English locally and abroad. I then heard Jake (Nuru Founder/CEO) speak at Redemption Church and walked up to him joking that he should give me a job. I started with Nuru a few weeks later and have now been with them for 5 years.

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

Nuru's mission is to end extreme poverty in remote, rural areas. Right now we have community development projects in Kenya, Ethiopia, and we're expanding to a third country next year. I am constantly inspired by my brilliant colleagues, our incredible local teams and farmers, and everyone's tireless efforts in achieving Nuru's mission. With a mission like this it isn't difficult to stay productive. Practically though with two kids at home, I have to utilize every minute of kid-free work-time to its fullest (well besides the important time I spend exploring the amazing Skype Mojis to ensure I start off my Skype meetings in style).

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

Our mission and our people. Nuru places a huge emphasis on our values and culture. We hire like-minded people that value what we value â€“ servant leadership, transparency, failing fast/learning fast, sustainability, and empowering those in extreme poverty to lift themselves out of poverty.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

As part of a start-up or nonprofit, there are often limited resources and the work can seem unending. My advice is to prioritize, prioritize, prioritize. Ask yourself "What must happen today, what can wait until tomorrow, what can be accomplished next week?" I start every day with prioritizing, which also helps with achieving better work-life balance. This is a huge passion of mine. Our staff work so hard that work-life balance is often neglected. It's so important to close the laptop, take a break, rest, let off some steam, get rejuvenated, or explore the latest new Skype Mojis. A 3pm outdoor coffee break should be on everyone's work calendar.

**Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?**

The people! The location! The coffee! (Huge shout-out to [Neat Coffee](http://neat.coffee), the best cup of happiness around.) Traditionally at Nuru, our 25 staff members have all worked-remote. We're now seeing the need for more and better collaboration. Sometimes there is nothing like working with actual humans in-person! Having a space at Wayfare for our Southern CA team has allowed for that in-person collaboration and has been life-changing for me (as the Skype Mojis have been. Have I established that point yet? :))
