Meet Love Light Paper Co! Focused on a mission to give love and give life, they make cards and products that empower others to love their friends and family well. 

Founder + designer Chelsea Cumming tells the story of Love Light Paper, and the bigger purpose behind their cards.

“I've always loved giving gifts and spending way, WAY too much time in greeting card sections, trying to pick out the 'exact perfect card' for whomever I was buying for. More often than not, I would find myself thinking, "if only I could find a card that had 'this' on it," or "if it only said 'that' instead." LoveLight Paper was born out of of this... my desire to make gift-giving personal and meaningful, rather than just ritual... to Give Love. I started designing cards with specific people in mind, so it could be the perfect card for that specific person. But I wanted these cards to go even beyond that... to Give Life... to sustain life beyond a simple material gift given. I sought out local non-profits that would help fulfill this desire, and found Kids Around The World's One Meal mission. Through their program, a portion of the proceeds from every item purchase goes to providing a meal to a child in need. It's a one-for-one style program, but some products give even more than one meal!

Through their stationary, Love Light Paper is bridging the gap for every day consumers to be a part of something bigger.  

Chelsea explains that, “Within cards and gifts, people communicate some of their deepest and most meaningful messages to one another... things that otherwise go unsaid on a daily basis. Most of our cards are left blank inside intentionally - so that you as the gift-giver or note-writer can be the one to make it meaningful... to deepen your relationships by loving one another. And as you give that card to someone, how special is it to know that you also just provided a meal for a someone else, somewhere else around the world! It's a gift that keeps on giving.” 

With running a social enterprise comes an immense amount of reward, but also its fair share of challenges and defeats. Chelsea + her husband, co-founders on a mission together, are fueled knowing that their simple products are able to literally give life and nourishment to children around the world. As consumers are giving these cards to friends and family for celebrations, milestones, and encouragement, an even more basic level of need is being met. Each product bought represents another life being sustained and nourished. It’s a gift that keeps on giving.
