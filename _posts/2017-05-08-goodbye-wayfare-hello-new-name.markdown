Remember back in January when [we announced we were changing our name](https://wayfare.io/stories/2017/01/18/say-goodbye-to-wayfare/)?!?! We asked for your submissions, and you delivered! However, we’ve been kinda quiet about things on these here interwebs...our lawyers told us to be hush hush, and we decided to obey. But we’ve been at work behind the scenes deciding on a name<!-- more -->,(no big deal, except it took us a lot longer than we thought it would), doing a whole bunch of paperwork (blech!), designing a lot of fun stuff (yay!), staying up really late (yawn), and even crying some legit tears (boo!). 

Oh yeah, we’ve also been recording every step of the way for a podcast all about how to pivot when an unexpected business challenge comes your way. 

The time is coming to announce the new name! We’re throwing a party for the big reveal and we'll be announcing a winner of the naming contest. It's all happening on May 18th and we couldn’t be more excited. 

Will you join us for our [Goodbye Wayfare, Hello New Name Party](https://wayfare.io/goodbyehelloparty/)? One party, two locations. [RSVP](https://wayfare.io/goodbyehelloparty/) to Fullerton or Costa Mesa. Free lunch. Be in the know. And help us spread the word. Wayfare will soon be...???
