At [Wayfare](wayfare.io) we believe that relationships are a catalyst for the world's best future. We believe that everyone has something to offer, and that mentorship can be a fantastic way for everyday people to make a significant impact in the life of another.  Mentorship is, at its core, intentionally engaging in relationship with another person and genuinely caring for them while providing the guidance they need to grow. This is the first in a series of posts that will outline various types of mentorship and programs facilitating it.

######**So, what does it take to be a mentor?**
 
1. Live some portion of your life. 
2. Identify a person who you are a few steps ahead of in life. This may be someone you already know or you could connect with someone through a formal program.
3. Hang out with them regularly with the goal of caring for them and providing some guidance and support as needed.

######**Mentoring Foster Youth**

Piggy-backing off of last month's focus on [Foster Care](http://blog.wayfare.io/2015/05/21/foster-care/), one of the things that found itself front and center in helping make a difference in the foster care system is the role that mentorship has in the life of a foster child.  A local organization called [Teen Leadership Foundation (TLF)](http://teenleadershipfoundation.com), has a mentorship program that serves teens who used to be in foster care. 

As one teen in [TLF's](http://teenleadershipfoundation.com) program puts it, **"Mentoring means a lot of different things to me now. It means I have someone who honestly cares about me."** To read more of his account jump on over to the [TLF blog](http://teenleadershipfoundation.com/blog/) and read [Who are You Mentoring?](http://teenleadershipfoundation.com/who-are-you-mentoring/) 

[TLF](http://teenleadershipfoundation.com) would be very appreciative of donations of fun experiences for the participants in their programs.  So if you are able to donate tickets to sporting events, s'mores supplies for a beach bonfire, surf or paddle board sessions, to name a few, [contact TLF](http://teenleadershipfoundation.com/contact/) to let them know you'd like to donate. 

If you aren't local to Southern California, if you do an internet search for a local mentorship program in your area, they can connect you with ways to get involved.
