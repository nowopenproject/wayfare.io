In the book of Genesis, we're introduced to God as he performs his initial acts of work in our universe. He created heavens and earth, water and sky, fish in the sea, birds of the air, beasts of the fields, and he called them good. Then he did something different. 
So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. 
28 God blessed them, and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over it. I have given you everything. And he said, It is very good.

So we see that Adama, the earth creature...the first human, was considered different than the rest of creation and was given dominion over it. More than that, Adama was given creation responsibilities. Being created in God’s image, in his likeness, meant that he was to also be a creator. A first creation task in chapter 2:19-20 was naming the animals, giving them identity. Adama began participating with God in his creation of the world.

But something changed. If you know the creation story, Adam and Eve disobeyed in the first act of self-interest. And this is important to note, because this original sin--self centeredness--was the act then and continues to be that act today that demotes work from creation to toil. The reason I believe this is so important is that we have to ground ourselves in God’s original intent for humanity and his identity for us if we are to understand how to participate with him today in his renewal of all things. 

So here’s the question: What is work, and how do we redeem it to its original intention?

Common usage: Work is my job, a means of earning an income. 
Dictionary definition: Work is an activity involving effort to achieve a purpose.
My definition: Work is any act of creation or re-creation for the common good and the world’s best future. This is the work God assigned to humanity--his image-bearers.

The Original Work = Creation

Self-centeredness makes work become toil. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Because if you embrace the metanarrative of Scripture, Jesus came to redeem all things, including work back to its original intent--creation.
