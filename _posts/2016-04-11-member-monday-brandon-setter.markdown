**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

Oh man. That's just not a fair question to ask a filmmaker. My automatic response is which Genre? But if I have to simply choose I don't choose a cliche filmmaker classic. I just pick the one dearest to my heart. First movie I saw in theatre, still relevant special effects, and just plain fun: Jurassic Park.

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

Semi local: Breakfast at Madison Square & Garden Cafe, Laguna Beach

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

All days, especially good ones start with a good pour over and most importantly Jess (my wife). This day would be with her for sure! First, we'd hop in a helicopter (I'd have my Helicopter pilots license), fly somewhere awesome and go helicopter camping/hiking. Of course we'd shoot another one of our Adventures of Brandon and Jess films along the way just for fun and a myriad of epic time-lapses. After finishing our hike we'd enjoy some time just swinging in our hammocks. We'd get tired of sitting around and so we'd get back in the heli to fly somewhere else for a wonderful dinner. As the sun grows low in the sky we'd fly to our remote cabin in the woods... as the twilight sky turns for orange to purple we'd be sitting by our huge cabin windows with a fire in the fireplace, Fixer Upper on TV, a time-lapse running outside (yes I'm a nerd) and a good cup of tea.

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

Patagonia and Antarctica - two places I simply MUST see with my own eyes.

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

I'm a filmmaker for small business, non-profits, and ministries. I got my start early on growing up on full-time staff at Hume Lake Christian Camps where I was able to learn from inspiring creatives there. All projects were done incredibly well, on no budget, with no time, and with great purpose. It taught me to be fast, strive for excellence, be creative with budget, and put intentional meaning into everything we do. Then on to Film School, nearly 10 years of freelance, and full-time creative ministry as a film prof at Biola and directing creative video content at ROCKHARBOR Church.... I've always tried to marry my love for ministry, my business mind, and love for shooting beautiful imagery and telling stories. Wether traveling the world for non-profits, making promos for startups and small business, shooting events or sharing stories... I love it all and would never trade getting to be apart of the whole process! I love it! PS: I've been doing front-end responsive web design with CMS all these years too.

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

Few things inspire me like being outside or traveling. These are the things that fuel my creativity: hanging out with Jess (my wife and I do everything together!), time-lapses and hammocks (relaxing), coffee (tasty productivity), the mountains (revitalizing), drone/helicopter video work (challenging and epic), and travel (the unknown).

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

Most of all it's about the fantastic people I get to meet and work with! I love seeing the passion of the startup owner giving their all to their dream, the non-profit ministry leader living out their calling, and the creative using their gift and talent to make the world a better place. Their stories and their work-ethic are humbling, inspiring, and a joy to be apart of! I love the process, the creativity, the travel, the adventure, and the challenge of it all.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

As a solo-filmmaker, the biggest challenges are single handedly managing all the moving parts of a film production from client relationships, to surrounding my self with a team, to planning and scheduling, to shooting high-budget looks on a tiny budget, and delivering a quality end product every time. I'm not one that enjoys multi-tasking - I prefer to focus well on one project at a time so that my mind is clear and the client gets the best work from me.... but that's more of an ideal rather than how life really works out.... All in all, it's that not that different from any other small business.... every new project is like launching a new startup each time.... all of us are in over our heads, but working for ourselves so we can do what we love to do! Over time I've learned one of the most important things is to say, "No" - its way harder to do than it sounds... but with every "Yes" there's also a "No" to something else - usually the things that matter most to me: my wife, rest, family, and fun. I believe in automating as much of my life as I can ([IFTTT.com](https://ifttt.com)); brain-dumping everything on my mind often into project management apps ([trello](https://trello.com) and [asana](https://asana.com)); staying on top of my finances with [YNAB.com](https://ynab.com) and [Quickbooks](https://quickbooks.com); calendaring everything ([Sunrise Calendar](https://calendar.sunrise.am) for Mac and iOS); communicating well with my teams ([slack.com](https://slack.com)); and continually finding new ways to maximize and simplify processes, gear, and time.

**Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?**

Initially I realized how many people I already knew from different circles - it was exciting to know I could be near that kind of energy and inspiration! I also wanted a place close to home where I could work that wasn't as transient or chaotic as a coffee shop, wasn't the risk of permanent space, provided a community of awesome people, was somewhere I'd be proud to invite my clients to chat, and overall felt comfortable and well designed! Oh and coffee.... thanks to Ally's [Neat Coffee](https://neat.coffee) the creative fuel still flows! Wayfare is a great fit!

**What are some ways we can support you and get involved with your work?**

My wife and I are dreaming towards some cool things coming soon: 1) We are embarking on huge life change as we are on the core launch team for a new Church Plant! As such, our goal is to have 5-7 new retainer clients in place so that we have more time to help with the church plant without being any financial or unpredictable schedule burden on the church plant. 2) We are always looking for new opportunities to partner with new clients and their dreams!
