Modern-day slavery exists in every country in some form or another. Sweatshops, prostitute rings, and domestic work are a few examples of the enslavement of men, women and even children. According to the [International Labour Organization](http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm), around 21 million individuals are forced into slavery each year around the world, and the impact of slavery is evident in nearly every aspect of our lives. <!-- more -->

“Slaves harvest cocoa in West Africa, and it ends up in our chocolate. Slaves make charcoal in Brazil, which is used to run smelters that make steel for our cars. Many food products and raw materials are tainted by slavery—such as tomatoes, tuna, shrimp, cotton, diamonds, iron, sugar, and gold.” – [Free The Slaves](http://www.freetheslaves.net)

Bringing an end to modern-day slavery is a fight that isn’t over, and we stand with the warriors around the world fighting on the frontline for complete redemption and freedom for all people.

One of the many incredible organizations that is committed to ending modern slavery is [Purpose Jewelry](http://www.purposejewelry.org), [iSanctuary’s](http://www.isanctuary.org) social enterprise. They are dedicated to helping every single woman they can, by giving her a second chance at life. 100% of their jewelry proceeds benefit [International Sanctuary](http://www.isanctuary.org), their parent non-profit organization, which provides holistic care for young women rescued from sex trafficking.

Among many other world-changing social enterprises, [Purpose Jewelry](http://www.purposejewelry.org) provides everyday opportunities for consumers like you and I to directly empower women in need worldwide. By buying a piece of [Purpose Jewelry](http://www.purposejewelry.org), you directly affect the life of a young survivor of sex trafficking across the world in six specific ways:

1. Medical & Dental Care

[iSanctuary](http://www.isanctuary.org) provides much needed medical and dental care to the women rescued from sex trafficking. This care can be for something as minor as a check-up to life-saving procedures. By buying a necklace, you could very well save someone’s life and help her stay healthy.

2. Education

[iSanctuary](http://www.isanctuary.org) has started an [Academy program](http://www.isanctuary.org/academy/), which provides every young woman in the program with opportunities to dream of a sustainable future by setting educational and personal development goals in four core areas, while earning an income. Many girls who escape or are rescued from modern-day slavery are hindered by their lack of education and employable skills. By buying a piece of jewelry and thus giving these girls and women an education, you are opening up doors to a better future and life.

3. Scholarships

In addition to providing education to the women they work with, [iSanctuary](http://www.isanctuary.org) also provides scholarships. With these scholarships, the women are given the opportunity to further their education, either through [The Academy](http://www.isanctuary.org/academy/) or to attend university. These scholarships are funded by your purchases from [Purpose Jewelry](http://www.purposejewelry.org).

4. Counseling

After experiencing the horrors of modern-day slavery and the sex trade, a woman needs a safe space to work through her experiences and feelings. [iSanctuary](http://www.isanctuary.org) provides support and counseling, helping the women heal. In addition to counseling, [iSanctuary](http://www.isanctuary.org) provides one-on-one mentoring and life skills training so women can confidently get back on their feet and regain independence.

5. Micro-loans

To regain independence, it is crucial that the survivors of modern-day slavery have basic financial skills and can financially support themselves. When necessary, [iSanctuary](http://www.isanctuary.org) provides loans to the young women who need them. At the same time, the women are taught financial skills and are helped in opening their own bank account so that they can be financially stable and independent.

6. Employment

Stability and routine is very important to a woman overcoming the trauma of modern-day slavery, and employment provides this stability. Through working for [Purpose Jewelry](http://www.purposejewelry.org), these survivors receive job training and paychecks. As a result, they don’t have to worry about job searches or finances, and they can focus on their healing.
