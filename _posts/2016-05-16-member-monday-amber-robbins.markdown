**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

American Beauty. (But It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is a close second!)

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

Joe's Sushi

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

Sleeping in, then a big breakfast with my family. Then maybe spend some time at the Farmers Market, clearly followed by a great dinner at the house, with some good friends and good wine.

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

Japan

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

I am the executive director of a non-profit production company. Every day I get to find new ways to brings stories, written by children, to life. I have been working with school children for years, performing in assemblies and workshops. Now I am able to expand on what I've learned, so we can inspire children from all walks of life to be creative.

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

I am so grateful for the startup programs at FLDWRK! They have taught us how to turn inspiration into the daily operations of the organization. Thankfully I get inspired by my work everyday!

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

Seeing the look on a student's face when they see their story, characters and ideas coming to life is the best thing ever.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

The biggest challenge we face is giving our different projects the right amount of attention. We are implementing a strong calendar system for all of our program directors and keep a weekly check-in with everyone as well.

**Why did you decide to work out of FLDWRK?**

I learned about FLDWRK's startup programs before I knew they also offered coworking plans. But I hope to stay working out of FLDWRK after the startup program has ended. It's a beautiful place to work!

**What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?**

I am looking forward to seeing fellow members at the Launch Night on May 26th! :)
