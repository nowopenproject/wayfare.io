The 2016-2017 school year is upon us and while Back to School is top of mind, we're featuring various action steps that can be taken to support the kids, teachers, parents, and schools in our community.

There are so many ways that any person can use what they have to contribute to the flourishing of our kids.  Today we are focusing on several ways to support kids in our area where **we each can play a role in raising up the next generation of leaders, creators, innovators, and world-changers.**<!-- more -->

### [Project Hope Alliance](http://www.projecthopealliance.org), Costa Mesa

According to their website, "Childhood homelessness is Orange County’s best-kept secret. Under its veil of affluence are the faces of more than 26,000 children experiencing homelessness and 126,000 children living in poverty. They say goodnight from motels, shelters, and couches."

"Housing and education are inextricably linked to each other, but there is hope. By stabilizing families in their own homes and providing their children with an exceptional education, we can and will break the cycle of homelessness."

**Action Step One // Volunteer**

Serve [Second Saturdays](http://www.projecthopealliance.org/secondsaturday/): Second Saturdays are quarterly opportunities to help their offices with a range of projects, such as organizing the food pantry, stuffing backpacks, working on administrative tasks, or creating crafts or art projects for kids they serve. This help, although simple, is significantly far-reaching. These volunteer days are a time for individuals of all ages (even small kids), families, and groups to connect with Project Hope Alliance's staff and mission while supporting the families they serve. [Click here](http://www.projecthopealliance.org/secondsaturday/) for more info or email [Connie](mailto:connie@projecthopealliance.org) with any questions or to sign you or your group up to volunteer.

**Action Step Two // In-Kind Gifts**

While financial donations are always appreciated, gifts of items, also known as in-kind gifts are also appreciated.  Their needs are frequently changing, so for an up to date list of current needs please visit the [Project Hope webpage about in-kind gifts](http://www.projecthopealliance.org/in-kind-gifts/).

### [The Literacy Project Foundation](http://literacyprojectfoundation.org), Newport Beach, CA

Contact: Kimberly Vig  
Email: kim@literacyprojectfoundation.org  
Office Phone: 949.721.1319

According to [The Literacy Project Website](http://literacyprojectfoundation.org),  

"Currently 45 million Americans are functionally illiterate and cannot read above a 5th grade level.              50% of adults cannot read a book written at an 8th grade level.
57% of students failed the California Standards Test in English. 1/3 of fourth-graders reach the proficient reading level. 25% of six million kids in California school systems are able to perform basic reading skills. 85% of juvenile offenders have problems reading. 3 out of 5 people in American prisons can't read. 3 out of 4 people on welfare can't read
(Sources: National Institute for Literacy, National Center for Adult Literacy, The Literacy Company, U.S. Census Bureau)."

"[The Literacy Project](http://literacyprojectfoundation.org) is leading the charge against growing illiteracy amongst school-age children. They are bridging the literacy gap by serving the literacy needs of struggling 2nd grade readers...the early makings of an at-risk student who may end up illiterate and lose all hope of living a productive adult life."

"[The Literacy Project](http://literacyprojectfoundation.org) offers a comprehensive instructional program that improves both academic and attitudinal levels of students performing far below English proficiency standards. The program is aligned with Common Core and collaborative learning methods, and is administered by Master Teachers who are product-trained experts and highly credentialed as reading and language arts specialists.

The program is provided at no cost to both the school and qualified students in the 2nd grade. This program teaches the fundamental principles of phonics in all three learning modalities - auditory, visual and tactile - critical to children with varying learning styles.

Their significant measurable results prove increased reading skill levels of up to 75% and positive increases in building self-esteem and better attitudes towards reading of up to 85%.

**Action Step // Donate**

Sponsor a struggling reader, donate toward expanding this unique program in all local elementary schools.

### Wilson Street Learning Center, Costa Mesa

Wilson St. Learning Center (WSLC) was formed in 2009 to provide a safe and comprehensive place for kids to go after school. The WSLC mission includes not just academic guidance but also meets the spiritual, physical, and emotional needs of the students that live nearby. Parents are an essential part of the WSLC and volunteer in the community through parenting classes, ESL, or joining nearby Wilson Elementary School’s PTA. Nearly 100 families participate and enroll their families in the opportunities at WSLC. After-school tutoring is every day from 3-5pm. Parenting classes are offered every Thursday evening 7-9pm.

**Action Step**:

Get involved by becoming one of the following: after-school grade level academic volunteer, coach sports, give prayer support, donate classroom supplies and sports equipment, help paint classrooms, and assist with parent ESL classes at night. Financial contributions to continue all these programs, fund scholarships for graduating students, and add academic coordinators would be graciously received.
