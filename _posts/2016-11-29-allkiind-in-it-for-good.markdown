In the middle of the hot summer of 2016 in a garage in Fullerton, CA, a few friends got together and dreamed. It may be cliché, but they wanted to create the best business they could imagine: an excellent brand with a pure heart. They wanted to do something truly good and make the world brighter. 
They talked and bonded and rallied around certain indispensable values. We brainstormed 50 possible names and wrote them on a whiteboard. We lived on iced coffee from Starbucks and Del Taco burritos (and they still have hundreds of hot sauce packets).<!-- more -->

> “[We] talked about our sincere desire to make the world better. We started with our values and built a business that would embody them”, said Luke Laubhan, Co-Founder & Co-CEO, “We knew we valued inclusiveness, and agreed that unity, positivity (the opposite of cynicism) and honesty are building blocks for a better reality. We aspired to be global. We liked the idea of 'mankind,' something that represents all of our infinite potential. [And] finally, Allkiind clicked.”

Somewhere in the midst of brainstorming and burritos on another 90 degree day, it all took shape. The dream materialized, and Allkiind was born. **Allkiind is a social enterprise that makes lifestyle products, speaks boldly into people and everyday culture, and financially supports a variety of causes and non-profits… all for the common good.**

Allkiind’s chief cause is to truly do good, across every aspect of the company, broadly and openly. Specifically, they’ve focused on three main areas:

1. **They've focused on building an ethical and responsible supply chain.** Allkiind wants to do it right at every level and for them, it means making as much as they can personally and locally where they can see things up close, and holding out for WRAP certification abroad. It also means being intentional about their environmental impact, from using recycled packaging to our own giant, blue recycle bin at HQ.

2. **They’re committed to speaking boldly. **Allkiind’s messaging aims to challenge and celebrate. They aspire to positively challenge themselves, others, the status quo, and injustice; and eagerly celebrate the good stuff in life: beauty, people, causes, and victories - there's so much!

3. **They give back tangibly to good deeds, charitable causes, and non-profits.** Allkiind is committed to making a tangible impact in the world, rolling up their sleeves and diving in it (for good). So, off the top, Allkiind donates 10% of its revenue to charitable causes and non-profits. There's no fuzzy math: If a customer buys a $10 item, Allkiind donates $1. When someone spends $100, they donate $10. It really adds up! They select causes and non-profits based on their team’s research and suggestions from the Allkiind community. To be transparent, they post their give-back stories on their blog (it’s a part of the whole celebration thing).

Allkiind is just a little over three months old (they launched in August '16), and they’ve already inspired and changed lives through their process and products. They’ve been able to provide everything from socks for the local homeless community to Halloween costumes for kids in need. Allkiind has donated school supplies, delivered headbands to those fighting cancer, and financially helped a variety of charitable organizations.

>  “With a small staff and a brand new operation, almost every step requires everyone's time and attention. That said, it's a uniquely collaborative environment, and it's fun to be all pulling in the same direction, working on different aspects of the same stuff. It really is a team effort. There's three of us working in a garage every day, building out a business from scratch. With all the work to do and a great big world in need, it's not hard to stay focused. To be honest, we still don't know everything Allkiind will be. That's part of the adventure. But we do know our values, [and] we feel like we're just getting started. Operating a business is a journey, and there's a lot to learn, but our mission fuels us: Allkiind will challenge ourselves and others, and it will celebrate the good.”

We’re inspired by the team at AllKiind team and the beautiful way they are pursuing work & the common good. They are a living example of “a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens [that] can change the world”, and they have.
