At Wayfare, we believe in the world's best future and this month we are focusing on and supporting education in our community.

####Education

Education, and literacy in particular, are key contributors toward a person's ability to achieve their fullest potential which will obviously allow them to live a fuller life, but will additionally enable them to use their gifts and talents help others.

To give you a glimpse of why access to education is so important, and to get an idea of simple things you can do to help, we reached out to a local organization called, [Trellis](http://www.wearetrellis.com), who has an education initiative as part of their programming.

Here is what they have to say:  

*In the US, we promote free, universal access to a public school education - yet due to standards-based testing, limited parental involvement, and over-extended teachers, it is increasingly difficult for our schools to meet the growing demands of education in our community.*

####Literacy

*We see this issue manifested most obviously in reading. Third grade literacy rates are a key indicator - for potential academic success or future academic and behavioral challenges.* 

***â€œA student who can't read on grade level by 3rd grade is four times less likely to graduate by age 19 than a child who does read proficiently by that time. Add poverty to the mix, and a student is 13 times less likely to graduate on time than his or her proficient, wealthier peer," read the report.** 

*Based on 2013 STAR testing results, many of our local elementary schools in Costa Mesa have a large number of 3rd graders that are not reading at grade level.* 

*In our Jr. High and High Schools there is an increasing number of students in need of positive adult role models. Imagine - you can't read past a 2nd grade level, except now you are in 8th grade and expected to read proficiently to learn new academic content. We are now seeing students drop out after 8th grade and never even make it through the doors of our local high schools.* 

*Yet dedicated and resourced individuals, working together, have an exciting opportunity to meet those needs, make learning fun, and facilitate student success. We can assist by providing resources and expertise in vital domains needed for modern, global workplace success.*

####Opportunities for Engagement
*As we connect and partner with schools, there are 4 primary areas that each provide unique opportunities for us to support public education in our city:*

**Facilities**: Beautification projects & Classroom improvement projects
**Staff**: Crates of Care & Appreciation Breakfasts/Lunches   
**Parents**: Free Classes in English, Computer Applications, 
Community Development, & Parenting Training
**Students**: Literacy support (during/after school) & [Mentorship](http://blog.wayfare.io/2015/06/22/mentorship/)

####Get Involved

[Trellis](http://www.wearetrellis.com) is a great resource in Costa Mesa to if you'd like to get involved with making positive change in public education in Costa Mesa (they also have several other initiatives).  [Mika](http://www.mikacdc.org) is a Community Development Corporation in Costa Mesa that provides after school tutoring to local students. We also suggest checking out [The Expectations Project](http://www.expectations.org). 

####School Supply Drive

From now until August 28th, we are accepting donations at Wayfare that will be contributed to the Community Resource Drive hosted by [Trellis](http://www.wearetrellis.com) on August 29, from 9am-2pm.  While you are shopping for school supplies, it would be fantastic if you'd consider purchasing a few extra items for kids who aren't able to do so and dropping them by [Wayfare](http://www.wayfare.io) or attending the event on August 29th.
