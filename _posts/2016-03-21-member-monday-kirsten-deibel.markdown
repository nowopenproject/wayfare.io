**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

Oh man. I have to name a few. I'm all over the place: Elf. Gladiator. She's The Man. The Sandlot.

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

The Attic in Long Beach. Order the Mac n' Cheetos. You're welcome.

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

Have some coffee and quiet time. Go for a surf with my husband. Play with our pup at the beach. Hunt some garage sales or Goodwill stores. Go check out a new restaurant for dinner. And all good days involve Yougurtland of course.

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

Croatia looks pretty dreamy (according to everyone's instagrams)

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

Right now I'm doing full time freelance graphic design. I LOVE what I do! But I didn't always. I originally got my degree in Business with an emphasis in Marketing. My first couple jobs were in Admin and Marketing positions. I always loved the people I worked with but I knew I was meant to keep moving/walking through the open doors God was providing. I went back to school for Graphic Design and fell in love with the trade. I could be creative, but serve others in their passions and endeavors by bringing their ideas to life. I held a few entry level graphic design positions after that and soaked up as much as I could through amazing coworkers. Two of those old coworkers left and started their own company in the Wayfare space. They invited me here for coffee a year ago. I came and saw other old coworkers in the space and knew it wasn't a coincidence. I knew god had been guiding my career path all along and he wanted me to step out in faith, come to Wayfare to begin my freelance career. I left my job and did just that. Ever since I've been ridiculously blessed with business, help, encouragement, drive, and peace.

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

By meeting other people, sharing stories, and remembering and believing that even in the small things we do we are serving a purpose. Even in the monotonous days, and even if we can't see the impact we made that day.

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

Brainstorming! It's the best. I love getting to hear clients get excited about their ideas and the possibilities of the design we are going to create together.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

Sometimes I worry about the amount of work I'm able to take on and if I'll be able to operate as one individual designer to serve all my clients well. So my advice and reminder to myself is to not worry about tomorrow. Just focus on today, do my best, and know the rest always works out.

**Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?**

People I really admired and trusted worked here. They believed in me and invited me in. Once I came, met with them, tasted the coffee, felt a sense of peace in here - that was all it took!

**What are some ways we can support you and get involved with your work?**

Keep being the amazing Wayfare community you've been! You can mention my name if you hear of someone needing graphics. I do web, print, and anything you'll let me get my hands on :)
