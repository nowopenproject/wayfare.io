Focused on a mission to feed Christmas dinners to families in need, Chris & Jesenia Pena created [Siestas for Fiestas](http://www.siestasforfiestas.com): blankets that provide hope and meals to families in Cancun, Mexico. For every blanket that is sold, a Christmas meal is provided to a family living in poverty in Cancun.

“[Siestas For Fiestas](http://www.siestasforfiestas.com) was born out of a desire to support our church in Cancun as they provide Christmas meals for families living in poverty. The church we attended while living in Cancun had a yearly project of providing families with Christmas meals. We were moving back to LA and wanted to find a way to support them. At the same time we had fallen in love with the material our blankets are made out of and thought, why don't we make beach blankets out of them and sell them to support the church? It started small with just 16 blankets, but has grown significantly in the last year. This is a blessing because the more blankets we sell, the more meals we can provide to families in need.” 

The dinners [Siestas for Fiestas](http://www.siestasforfiestas.com) provides are packaged in a way that families can easily pick up at the local church and take back home to enjoy as a family on Christmas Eve. The meal includes a rotisserie chicken, 2 pounds of soup, 2 pounds of salad, a 2 liter soda, 4 dinner rolls, and paper goods (utensils, plates, and napkins). All is packed inside a reusable container with a sticker that, when translated says, "Jesus goes with me". By providing families with meals, they are able to share love and hope with families who are really struggling financially. Most of the families they serve live in homes that don't have electricity or access to water, making it hard for them to have a hot, homemade meal. Christmas is usually spent like any other day, but the meals provided by Siestas for Fiestas give them something special to enjoy with their families. Through this they know they are loved and not alone.

“The most life-giving part of our work is knowing that we are being used to provide for God’s people. We have no idea what we’re doing most of the time. We didn’t study fashion and don’t know how to sew, and running a business is hard work. This is why it’s so important to make it a point to focus on our mission & remember why we started when things get hard. We constantly tell ourselves ‘You are feeding a family, this is worth it!’ Knowing we are providing meals to families so they can have a Christmas fiesta keeps us determined through the hard times.” 

Through their mission, [Siestas for Fiestas](http://www.siestasforfiestas.com) is bridging the gap for everyday consumers to be a part of something bigger. Each blanket provides a meal for an entire family, and their customers have the opportunity to buy a blanket and directly bless a family across the world on Christmas day. In the next year, [Siestas for Fiestas](http://www.siestasforfiestas.com) will be working closely with their church in Cancun on new projects that create opportunities for those living in poverty so they may provide for themselves and their families to end poverty in the areas surrounding Cancun, Mexico. 

Join them in their mission by buying a blanket at [Spread Joy Market](https://wayfare.ticketleap.com/spread-joy/) here at FLDWRK Costa Mesa on Saturday, December 3rd from 11AM-4PM.
