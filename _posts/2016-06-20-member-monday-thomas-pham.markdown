**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

Devil Wears Prada

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

Hamamori at South Coast Plaza for Sushi!

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

Catching up on TV shows and sleep. I'm particularly fond with watching Quantico right now. However, I'm usually watching shows like: The Office, How I Met Your Mother, Mindy Project, and Friends. 

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

I'd want to visit Singapore. I've heard the food is GOOD there! 

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

[SLIQUE Media](http://www.sliquemedia.com) is a marketing/branding company that primary focuses on restaurants and franchises. We can do as little as manage our client's Facebook and Instagram, or as far as working with them from idea to a fully open restaurant. Logos, design, social media, and strategies are our forte. I also own The Halal Guys here in Southern California, and that is a New York street food concept that I franchised. Its a top 3 most Yelped restaurant in the country, and one of the top places to eat in NYC. We have two locations open, with a 3rd opening in less than a month, and 2-3 more slated by the end of the year. We serve chicken & gyro over rice with our famous white sauce and explosive hot sauce! 

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

I spend a lot of my time listening to podcasts and learning from those that have done it. Tim Ferriss' life hacks are great. Additionally, I have some mentors I work with, and I enjoy mentoring others as well. 

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

My favorite part of work is seeing that our clients are happy with our services as we strive to go above and beyond. For the restaurant - I like to mingle with first time guests and see what they think about the food. Good or bad, feedback is always important for our success. 

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

Some of the biggest challenges that I've been working on and overcoming is how to delegate. As a business owner, you're only one person. Its important to learn to delegate and build a team around you that you trust that can execute. Putting processes in place is important. Someone once told me "Thomas, could you build your company if you were never able to leave your house?" The answer is yes! With the right processes in place, and the right people surrounding you, you can absolutely build a restaurant or a business without ever going out your front door. If anyone has questions about this, I'm happy to share more! 

**Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?**

I wanted to work around like-minded individuals in a cool work environment. I get the most done being away from my Team. Its worked out, and I've gotten to meet so many cool individuals. I'm always busy, but if I haven't met you yet, tap me on the shoulder, because it would be my pleasure to get to know more of my neighbors. 

**What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?**

I'm always looking to help more businesses win. If there are businesses or restaurants that are looking for an in-house marketing team with an emphasis on social media, we can absolutely help! We pride ourselves in giving our clients amazing service and making them feel like they're our only client.
