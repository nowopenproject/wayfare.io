I've heard it said that when there is a choice to be right or be kind, choose kindness. I love this sentiment and often encourage my kids to think in this way. But in reality, don't both matter? Truth without kindness tends to fall on deaf ears, and kindness without truth really isn't kind, its flattery. True kindness isn't necessarily being nice, but is a desire for the best outcome for yourself and for the other. This usually entails working together. Not just tolerating working alongside someone occupying space in close proximity by not ruffling feathers. But actually doing work in cooperation with one another...working together. 

From people on your team at work, to people you rub shoulders with in a shared workspace (yay coworking!), to working with and advocating on behalf of others, working together is important. As we identify needs (and they are all around us, aren't they?) and consider how to help, it often means working with people who are different than us. Whether they are the perpetrator of the problem you are trying to solve, or someone very different than you who feels called to the same work, we all encounter moments when differences come to the surface and we need to work together to make progress, or possibly make no progress at all. 

If working together is important, how do we accomplish the important work? Let's start with the people... always start with the people. 

**1."Why Not Both?"**

Fun little story... my great grandfather was acquantainces with Henry Ford. Mr. Ford approached him to see if he'd invest in his idea of a "horseless carriage". My great grandpa said that was impossible. "You either take the train, or you hitch your horses to a carriage and get on with it", he said. Would his decision to invest been different if he had asked, "Why not both?". 

We make thousands of tiny decisions every day and most of the time we don't even realize it. In these tiny instances "either/or" decision making is fairly inconsequential. Deciding on things like jeans or shorts, pizza or mac and cheese, and the freeway or surface streets can usually be solved easily and without much consequence. (Although as a side note: I do think mac and cheese pizza is pretty amazing. Don't knock it until you try it. Unless you are lactose intolerant. Then definitely don't try it.) 

But when it comes to the more significant things in life where a person's personal, religious, or moral convictions come to the surface, that is where the tensions typically arise. So when these situations arise, turning off the autopilot of the "either/or" thinking we use thousands of times every day can be beneficial as we work together. More delicate situations entail more thoughtful work. This is where "both/and" thinking comes in handy. For example, can a person BOTH hold their personal convictions strongly, AND respect the right of another to hold their own (differing) personal convictions just as strongly no matter how much they disagree? Absolutely. And in this very act...they can each find something on which they agree which a great place to start. At its core "Both/And" thinking and decision making starts with listening to the other perspective and working together to see if there is a way to accomplish a positive outcome for each person, rather than choosing either one or the other. This often results in the emergence of a never before considered third way (I repeat: MAC AND CHEESE PIZZA!!!). It is fascinating to see the results what comes of asking the question "Why Not Both?" So next time you're at a crossroads when working with someone ask yourself. 

2. "Help Me Understand"
About a year ago I was feeling particularly frustrated as I found myself dealing with feeling of frustration in a friendship. I was seeking advice from a couple of friends and in our conversation I exclaimed, "It is just so messy!" To which they both responded. "When you're interacting with real people, in real life, that's exactly what it is."  And in their kindness they didn't leave me hanging, but encouraged me to use these three magic words -- "Help Me Understand". And now I should probably may my friends a million dollars (or just treat them to a more budget friendly cup of coffee). I use those three words at least weekly, if not daily, in a variety of circumstances. It has been a total game changer for me. Some examples: "Help me understand your thought process." "Help me understand how you reached this conclusion." "Help me understand what your experience is like in this." 

So as we live lives and aspire to work together to advance good in the world, these two simple phrases, might make a world of difference.
