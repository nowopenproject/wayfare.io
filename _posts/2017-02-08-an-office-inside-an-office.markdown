You started something! That's a big deal. Whether you've been at it for awhile or you are just starting out and are exploring the idea of moving to your own office space. We've asked a few of the members that have dedicated offices at Wayfare why they have chosen to have their offices and build their team inside of the a shared workspace environment rather than in their own private office space. Four main themes emerged. Community, Flexibility, Resources, and Business Growth. Read on to see what they had to say.  
 
## The Community (for you and your team) 

"We love having our own personal space, but I also love seeing how my team is part of the greater community of people within Wayfare and I think it helps them have a better work experience than we'd have if our team was isolated in our own space without interaction and encouragement from others." -Jon F., [Cappital](http://www.cappital.co) 

"I came from working alone in a windowless office to a place where there is life happening to the fullest. I no longer leave my day exhausted and drained, but with new ideas, new questions, and a new sense of energy to take me into the next day." -Erica N., [Redemption Church](http://redemptionchurch.org)

"Wayfare fosters a unique culture and brings together a big family. This aligns with the philosophy that's deeply rooted in the business."- Han L., [Morale Agency](http://www.moraleagency.com)

We wholeheartedly agree! Running your own business or organization is hard and can be draining. It is great to be able to share some of the things that are going on in our work and receive encouragement from others who have walked or are walking the same path.  Sometimes all you need is the encouragement to keep going or some insight that you'd likely never come up with on your own. That is where being surrounded by other people outside of your own organization is a huge help. 

## Flexibility in Team Growth

"When you are starting something new and growing your team it is impossible to know how quickly or how slowly you'll grow and add people to your team. As we grow I can just add people to my team, use the office when we need it, but if I need to have a private meeting, they can work outside in the open space.- Jon. F., [Cappital](http://www.cappital.co)

## Low Commitment

"I have no clue what our office needs will be in 5 years or even 3 years from now. But with the month-to-month flexibility and the ability to add employees as we grow, it is the perfect solution for us and we don't need to keep moving offices as we add more people. We keep our dedicated office and just add employees who can work out of the main coworking space." 
  
## Opportunities for Collaboration and Business Growth

"Having the ability to make connections and interact with people within the greater coworking community provides natural ways to connect and grow our business, gain customers and connections, and explore new ideas. In the shared workspace environment we get to know so many people who can speak into what we are doing and help us see things from a new perspective because they have an outside point of view that we don't have."
