**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

Legally Blonde, duh.

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

I live in LA, sooo I really don't know the local restaurants well! Anyone want to take me to dinner? 

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

This is tough, because my initial reaction is to say I'd work out, clean my house and catch up on some reading. But that sounds so boring but that's how I normally spend my days off.. In my IDEAL world life, I'd probably head to the beach with some wine and cheese and a blanket. Ending the day with Thai food and my husband. I'm not hard to please!

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

Thailand. I'm fascinated by their food, culture and landscape :)

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

Where to start... I do a lot of things for work. I'm a freelance graphic designer but spend most of my time working on Yellow Co. I graduated college at CBU with a degree in graphic design and digital media. I worked at a firm in Newport for about a year after school, got married, moved to LA and have worked as a freelancer for the past 4 years. Yellow was an idea that came to me in the shower - a place where our brains can finally slow down for a moment, allowing us to pay attention to our ideas. I had recently met some amazing women who were doing such great things in the world. I was thinking about how cool they were, and how it would be so awesome to get a group of women like this together to talk about and teach others how to use your gifts to spread good. I have a lot of ideas on a day to day basis (too many!!) but this was one I knew I had to follow through with. It was one of those things that made my heart beat fast, made me feel extremely scared, yet totally excited at the same time. I knew it had to happen! 2 years later, here I am, building this company and working towards making it my full time gig!


**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

I think I am most inspired by people I meet. Whether online or off, I’m fascinated by people, especially creatives. I am intentional about making time to meet with women I meet on social media for coffee and hearing their stories. I love digging into what makes them tick, figuring out what people want, looking at what’s popular in culture. This kind of stuff fuels me. I also and huge into audio books right now. A book filled with good information is total inspiration for me. As far as productivity goes, I have an ongoing to-do list in my planner, and I try my best to have 2 days a week where I schedule no meetings, and just have work time. I have found that I need uninterrupted time with my headphones on in order to get stuff done. If I'm not intentional about scheduling my week around prioritizing this, I don't get as much done. I have a beautiful and inspiring studio in the Arts District of LA. It's my happy place. When I'm here, I put my headphones on, get out my to-do list and I get shiz donnnee.

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

I can't choose. I love so much of it. I love learning, I love growing, I love being challenged, I love meeting inspiring women, and I love playing. I get to do all of these things everyday and I'm beyond thankful. There's not a day that goes by where I don't thank God for this season of my life.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

There's a ton of challenges. The ones that come to mind are the finances and just making money in general. I tend not to prioritize money, but it's essential when you're running a business. Being intentional and having a plan is key. Money is a tool, that's all it is. The better you manage it, the better you'll be able to use the tool. If your body tenses up when you hear the word budget, I'd encourage you dig deep and think about what the real reason you're not wanting to dig into that is. If you know what stops you, you can pinpoint it and move past it. And maybe treat yourself to ice cream after you tackle it :) I'm all about rewarding yourself for the small victories!

**Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?**

Wayfare is far for me. Like 1.5 hours far. So I really LOVE the peeps to come so far for them! There's a few reasons I chose Wayfare. 1- Values. Their values align directly with mine, which is SO important to me. 2- [Wayfare Labs](http://wayfarelabs.org). I mean, I really come to Wayfare for Labs, and what I've learned about business, life and my faith from these guys is knowledge and wisdom I'll take with me throughout my entire life. 3- Attitude. These people are super talented and have amazing stuff happening, but they do it all without egos. Like, none. It's so rare to find people like that and when I find them I want to surround myself with them!
