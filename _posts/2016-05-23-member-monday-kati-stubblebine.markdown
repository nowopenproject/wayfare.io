**Who are you?**

**What's the name of your company/organization?**
[Coach.me](https://www.coach.me)

**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

A League of Their Own

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

Sessions West Coast Deli 

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

Any day is a good day if I'm surrounded by good people and good dogs. The best days also incorporate great coffee, a hike, and some sort of sporting event (preferably baseball or basketball). 

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

I am in the very beginning stages of planning a trip to Peru next Summer, which will fulfill a lifelong dream! I've always wanted to hike Machu Picchu, and I've heard that barely breaks the top 10 list of things to do in Peru, so I'm stoked. 

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

I'm working as the Marketing Coordinator for Coach.me, which in all honesty fell into my lap. My brother is the founder, and Coach.me is the product of many years of him dreaming it up. I started doing work for him as a side project, but ended up really loving it. I'm only a year out of school, and still working on nailing down exactly what I want to do, so it's awesome to get to work with my brother and help him achieve his dreams while I figure out how to chase after my own. 

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

Coach.me is a platform that connects people with one-on-one coaching for a plethora of goals, and one of the main habits that's coached is Productivity. Because of this, I've tried a lot of different tricks, and there are three things that have proven very effective in keeping me on track and productive: Writing a to-do list each morning with one main goal for the day, only checking my email during pre-set times that stay the same every day, and meditating briefly each morning. I'm not to the point where I can meditate for long periods of time, but spending 5 minutes each morning clearing my mind lets me approach each day in a fresh way.

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

My favorite thing about work is getting to learn from everyone on the team. Getting to understand the behind the scenes of projects, even ones I don't have any part in, is an incredible learning opportunity. 

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

One of the biggest challenges is working in a company that's dispersed, because communication can be hard when there's no face-to-face interaction. My advice is to never underestimate the power of chit-chat. We have a check-in round each morning where we talk about things that are non work-related, which makes communication about work-related issues throughout the day much easier. It opens those channels right from the get go.

**Why did you decide to work out of FLDWRK?**

I really like getting up in the morning with somewhere to go. It gives my day a lot more intention than just walking from my bedroom to my kitchen table and sitting down to work. What I realized after I started working here was that I also really missed having a sense of community. There's something about surrounding yourself with like-minded people all working towards something that can't be reproduced. 

**What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?**

I've had a dream for a long time of starting a non-profit that provides scholarships for kids to get involved in sports. I'm planning to start working on this as a side project this summer, but I have no idea what I'm doing, so any advice about where to start or how to get the ball rolling would be greatly appreciated!
