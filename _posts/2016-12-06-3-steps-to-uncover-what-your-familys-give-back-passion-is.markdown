The holidays typically bring about the sudden urge to get the family together and go out and do some good. While I love the passion everyone has, it can also be quite stressful trying to find what it is you want to do, and how to go do it. I see families get all into a tizzy about it which lead to me getting frantic emails around December 20th saying, “omg, I want to help people. Help me.” I tell ya, it’s quite the job I get to do!
 
This season certainly is a great time to highlight how meaningful it is to give when we are inundated with the trappings of getting – getting yummy food, getting presents, getting peppermint mochas, etc.
 
This year if you want to break the cycle (or at least the sugar high) and are considering volunteering with the family, but don’t know where to start, I have a great little guide for you that breaks down what fits your family best. The more personal to the values of your family the better. I recommend getting kids involved and asking them what they think really matters. You’ll have to do the Googling once you uncover your passion, but this will get you where you need to be in terms of how and where you want to give.

Once you’ve gone out and volunteered, be sure to recap with the family. Ask them what they liked and didn’t like, if they want to do it again, and how they feel helping others.
 
With these three steps, uncover your family’s give back passion. Circle which option makes sense to you and then create your list of what to look for.
 
1.The first thing to decide on is who to help. This is a personal preference and often will be based on the current demographics of your family, who you’re close to, or something that has impacted you directly.

* Kids
* Homeless
* Military
* Elderly
* Families
* Environment
* Animals
* The Ill
 
2. The second element of your giving will be based on where you want to help. Are you excited about your local community, or do you have a heart for Malaysia? Decide where you want to make an impact, and tack that onto your list.

* Your neighborhood
* Your city
* Your county
* Your state
* Your country
* Your world
 
3. The final step in uncovering where your family give back passion is, is in thinking about how you want to help. Some families are comfortable going down to a local shelter to feed the homeless, and some would rather craft at home and write letters to soldiers – there are options for everyone!

* Hands on service
* At-home projects
* Going outside
* Being inside
* Serving the person you are helping face to face
 
Woo hoo! You now know just how your family can make the biggest impact, for you. No matter what you do this year, we commend you. This season is one of the best to start in on a tradition of giving, of service, and of community.
