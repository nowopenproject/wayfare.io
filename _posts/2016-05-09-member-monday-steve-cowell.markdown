**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

"Utah, get me two!" - Point Break

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

If it really has to be narrowed down to just one, currently it is Playground in Downtown Santa Ana. You have to understand that this is a very loaded question for someone like me..

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

A breakfast that involves sweet and savory, at least 2 cups of great coffee, being outdoors, and time with my lovely wife and two amazing daughters.


**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

Iceland...it's a photographer's dream. This is also a tough question because there is so much of the world 
I haven't seen and I want to see it all.


**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

I'm a lifestyle photographer...the core of my business is currently focused on weddings, but my aim is to incorporate documentary-style lifestyle shoots as another element of my business. I spent 8 1/2 years in outside sales having the life sucked out of me. I never believed in what I was selling nor did I really connect with my customer base since it was such a transactional relationship. After being laid off multiple times, I finally had enough and decided to attempt a full-time jump into photographer. By God's grace, I had life breathed back into me and He validated that this was what I was meant to do by allowing me to support my family through it as well as find deep fulfillment in doing it everyday. Now I believe in what I am providing my client base and my interactions/relationships that I build are far from transactional.

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

Working around other inspiring and creative people. Not to turn this into a plug for FLDWRK, but since coming to work here I have found my productivity and creativity has exponentially improved! Quality conversations with other people who are entrepreneurs inspires me to do better work and do it more consistently. Also, the coffee...the coffee is great.

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

Providing my clients/friends with a tangible takeaway from some of the biggest days of their lives...images that allow them to relive their favorite moments over and over again...images they can share with their kids and grandkids. Every wedding, family shoot, maternity shoot is different for me because it's about the people that I'm shooting and connecting with them. My goal is the same with every shoot, to connect with the hearts of the people in front of my lens, to find out what makes them smile and breathes life into them. That's what keeps my job fresh.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

The comparison game is a huge challenge in the creative realm. It's so easy to focus on what everyone else is doing and tell yourself the lies that you will never do as good, be as good, or create enough to compete or make an impact. Truth is, you have a unique product that is perfect for the right client...no one can do "you" and no one can create exactly what you do. As soon as you stop trying to copy others success or work you can start to create what is right for you and explore new levels that you didn't know were possible.

**Why did you decide to work out of FLDWRK?**

Previously I was working from home, but I found that it was far to easy to get distracted from my work. I'm such a people person and I'm a little ADD, so having other productive people around me to have short conversations with as well as the music and beautiful environment...that all seems to focus my attention on the work at hand. I honestly could not imagine a better place to work at.

**What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?**

This is very much a word of mouth industry, so of course telling others about my work is huge! Also, if there is a way I can collaborate with you on stuff, ask! I love working with other creatives to help advance their work too!
