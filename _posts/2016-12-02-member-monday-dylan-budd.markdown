**Who are you?**

Dylan Budd

**What's the name of your company/organization?**

Roots Community Church

**The best movie of all time is clearly....**

Gladiator...duh :) 

**What's your favorite local restaurant?**

Il Dolce (Harbor/19th)

**How would you spend your ideal day off?**

With my family, in our pajamas!

**If you could go anywhere in the world you haven't been, where would you go and why?**

That's a good question. I would love to visit Rome and scour the rich history embedded in that part of Europe. 

**What do you do for work? Tell us a little bit about how you got to where you are today.**

I am a bi-vocational pastor. I have the privilege of pastoring a local church here in Costa Mesa along with two other pastors. I also have the privilege of working part time for a local building material company. I've been pastoring for a little over 7 years and working in the construction industry for almost 13. 

By God's grace, He called my wife and I to Orange County for college and decided to keep us here to serve in the local church. It has been one of the greatest joys of our lives. 

**How do you stay inspired? Productive?**

The gospel. If the gospel is true, that is, that God in Christ has paid the highest price in order to redeem sinners (of whom I am chief)- if that is true, then I have an endless well of inspiration and motivation. The love of Christ is incredibly compelling. 

**What's your favorite part of your work?**

Ministering the gospel through preaching and counseling. I get to show people Jesus in the bible week after week. I can't think of a greater privilege in life.

**What are some of the biggest challenges of your work and what advice would you give to someone experiencing similar challenges?**

The greatest challenge is working through the deception of my own heart. The greatest fight in my life is inward. So my advice for minsters of the gospel would be: the gospel you preach is the gospel you desperately need. Love it 

**Why did you decide to work out of Wayfare?**

I needed a space that could accommodate both vocations. Wayfare was a perfect fit and location for me. 

**What are some ways (if any) we can support you and get involved with your work?**

The culture at Wayfare encourages members to partner together for the good of our city. That has already happened in many practical ways!
