######**Mentoring Leaders in Low-Income Neighborhoods**
In April, [FLDWRK](fldwrk.io) chose Community Development as our monthly focus and we chose [Mika Community Development Corporation](mikacdc.org) in Costa Mesa as our main  partner for this focus. It was a joy to see people from all over Costa Mesa and Orange County gather as [FLDWRK's coworking space](fldwrk.io/workspace) transformed into a Taco Tuesday fundraiser for this awesome organization in collaboration with the 
[Orange County Community Foundation's Giving Day Fundraiser](http://www.oc-cf.org). The fundraiser was a great success, but funds are just one portion of the greater picture in terms of supporting Mika.  **Relationships are the core of what Mika is about, and mentorship is a key part of the mission of this awesome non-profit organization.**

As their website explains, **Mika exists to identify and equip leaders with VISION in low-income communities of Costa Mesa.** Recognizing that there are many resources in our community that address the economic needs and basic relief to people in low-income communities, Mika’s unique work is to reconcile the relational factors that contribute to poverty.  Mika engages neighbors in an empowering process in order to address the broken relationships that prevent the poor from making decisions necessary to overcome poverty.

Mika’s Community Building process ensures that the residents have ownership of the progress achieved in their communities.  Mika also serves as a bridge between the neighbors and resources outside their communities.  **As neighbors grow in their understanding of the resources available to them in the larger community, they are able to link with partners who will help them reach their shared vision.**  

Tutoring, Youth Action Team, English Classes, and Summer Surf Club are a few of the many ways to become involved with Mika as a volunteer or mentor. If you are interested in learning more, please [contact them](http://www.mikacdc.org/contact-us/) or visit their website at mikacdc.org.  They are informational meetings and trainings throughout the year. [Click here](http://www.mikacdc.org/infonights/) find out the date of the next [info night](http://www.mikacdc.org/infonights/).
