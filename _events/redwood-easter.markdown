Join Redwood Community Easter Sunday as they launch their church plant in the heart of Downtown Fullerton.

“Redwood is a community of Jesus followers who simply seek to live like him. We exist to invite our community to sit at the table with Jesus no matter where we find ourselves in life. Our services include a time of worship, teaching through scriptures, prayer, and response (Family Friendly). On Easter we’ll have a BBQ brunch directly after the service with food provided by Jav’s BBQ!”
