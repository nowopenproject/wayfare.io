Have you been a part of the artwalk in the past, or are you interested in being a part of the artwalk in the future? On May 17th, Wayfare will be hosting an informational mixer led by Jessie La Tour. Weâ€™ll be discussing the future of the art walk and how each of our business can play a part.

This is also a great opportunity to get to know your fellow art lovers and be reacquainted with the Fullerton art walk community.
