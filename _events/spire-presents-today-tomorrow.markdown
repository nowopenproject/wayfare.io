Being a creative and designer is to be constantly thinking ahead about what is next. Whether it be visual design, UI or branding, we are consumed and influenced by what is on and over the horizon. For Christ-seekers, we are equally confronted and inspired by the future that God has planned for us and the implications that it carries. On April 8, Spire invites you to join us as talented design leaders in the creative industry discuss how those worlds collide and what it means to be designing for tomorrowâ€¦today.
