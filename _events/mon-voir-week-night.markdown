JOIN US FOR A MID-WEEK, EVENING FLORAL WATERCOLOR CLASS!

This three hour course is a perfect fit for beginning watercolor artists or for those looking to find a different approach to their skill! This class will start off with going through quality materials and which brushes and supplies Jenna prefers to use. She'll then cover tips and techniques for brush strokes, creating basic shapes, color theory and blending. Once you've gone through this material, you will incorporate how you've structured basic shapes into florals! Jenna will go over which brushes to use in order to form leaves, berries, peonies and more! With layering, shading, wet-in-wet painting, and other techniques Jenna prefers to use.
