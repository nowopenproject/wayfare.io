Wednesday March 8th, at 7pm at Wayfare Costa Mesa! Jennifer and Amy Hood of branding agency Hoodzpah Design and Odds and Sods will talk Spontaneous Storytelling. 
Curated content has become stale and meaningless. With the rise of Facebook live, Instagram Stories, Snapchat and more, it’s obvious that audiences crave genuine content and real behind the scenes looks at your brand and personal story. Free beer, free pizza from Z Pizza, free snacks from Country Archer Jerkey and Kind Snacks, and free water from People Water. Tell a friend, and don’t forget to RSVP!
