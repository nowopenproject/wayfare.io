Join 10,000 participants in 80+ cities as we gather to learn and consider how to advance good in our local communities. You'll have the ability to join a local conversation about one of the most pressing and challenging topics to think well about - Division. Our nation is divided across culture and politics, but that doesn’t mean we can’t start talking about how to foster unity. You won't want to miss this event!
