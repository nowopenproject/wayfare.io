We have neighbors who are experiencing homelessness within our community everyday. This education piece covers the following:

* Understanding homelessness (Future in Humanity)
* Mental health in relation to homelessness (St. Jude)
* Best practices (Fullerton PD Homeless Liaison Officers)
* How you can help (Fullerton ACT)
* Why we should love our neighbors well (Optional faith component at the end given by Fullerton ACT)

We hope that after this event you gain a little more understanding of the issue and gain compassion towards those currently without a home.
