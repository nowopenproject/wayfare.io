This month at Connecting Things, Bayan Joonam, an emmy-winning filmmaker and the Head of Production at SoulPancake, is giving a talk entitled Design, Detach, Repeat. Link below for more info and to RSVP!

**Design, Detach, Repeat**
It can be a hard pill to swallow, but the truth is that your first idea is probably crap. Even your second or third one. Waiting to get started until “the right inspiration” hits is a negative sum game. Getting wrapped up in finding that “one perfect” solution becomes a serious handicap for artists who have not yet embraced the process of iteration. It is through that process that we can constantly evolve into making all the right decisions when it comes to design, editing, building a brand, and life in general. So join Bayan Joonam as he talks about failing your way to success and recognizing that the most successful people are in constant beta.
