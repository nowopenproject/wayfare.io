Maece Seirafi will be at Wayfare Costa Mesa for a paper crafting workshop. This workshop is for anyone wanting to learn a new skill set and experiment endlessly with paper and lights to create beautiful modern lanterns and candle holders. These lanterns are perfect for displaying during the upcoming month of Ramadan or enjoying in your home year round.
