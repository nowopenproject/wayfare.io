If you have begun creating a startup, are running a small organization, or are simply considering taking a great idea to action, **this hands-on workshop will guide you through mapping the 9 essential building blocks of your venture**.  This includes: helping you foster creativity in building new revenue streams, communicating your value proposition, identifying new customer segments, 
bringing clarity to focus your work and increase your productivity, and give you a forum for testing your ideas with like-minded founders.

The workshop will be facilitated by Jeff Tanner, co-founder of Wayfare. Jeff has used the business model canvas as a sensemaking and visioning tool to guide small to mid-sized organizations to clarify their mission and strategy. **Workshop fee includes materials to complete the canvas and lunch!**
