Hey, we love you. You are an important part of this community, and we really wouldn’t be here without you. For that, we thank you in one of the best ways we know how – gifts! Because who doesn’t like gifts?!

As a small gesture of thanks for being a part of Wayfare, we’ve put together a few discounts (and some free stuff) for you to experience yourself, share with a friend, or both!  When it comes to your work, your ideas, and most importantly, this community – we believe experience is everything and invite you (and your friends) to participate in the fullness of FLDWRK.
