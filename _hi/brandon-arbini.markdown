**On the weekend you can catch Brandon:** swimming with his three kids, jamming on the guitar while his son plays the drums, and wrapping up the day reading by the fire pit. Top that off with a family adventure or a date with his wife, and he’s a happy man. It also helps if he has an ice cold Americano from Neat Coffee or a LaCroix in his hand at all times. The flavor? Pamplemousse of course!

**Be sure to ask Brandon about:** his childhood lemonade stand that got shut down by the city, the time he jumped off a cliff in Hawaii, how he won over his wife with crispy m&m’s and orange juice, or the time he lived in the Santa Cruz mountains where he had to protect his home from an aggressive wild turkey.
