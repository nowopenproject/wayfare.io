**On the weekend you can catch Allison:** exploring new places, biking around Costa Mesa, and always rushing to make it to Á La Minute before it closes to get her favorite Fresh Mint Chip ice cream.

**Be sure to ask Allison about:** where the best Taco Tuesday place is and why she’s convinced that South Carolina is the best place to live.
