**On the weekend you can catch Jonathon:** in a flurry of emotions as he cheers on his beloved Oakland Raiders, being way too excited about whatever he is eating at the moment, or in a dangerously competitive game of monopoly with his wife (loser does the dishes).

**Be sure to ask Jonathon about:** how many addresses heâ€™s had, his Bar Mitzvah, and the time he was at a funeral and it turned into a surprise Stevie Wonder live performance.
