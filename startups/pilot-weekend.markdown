### Overview

Pilot Weekend is designed to help you begin bringing to life that world-changing idea that you are passionate about. Whether you are a founder with a brand new idea or you are piloting a new product within your existing organization, Pilot Weekend is designed specifically for you. The Pilot Weekend kick-starts your plan and helps you create the roadmap for your idea to become a reality alongside a community of other dreamers, doers, and adventurers for the common good.

The Pilot Weekend combines insight from startup experts with hands-on application in a workshop setting. You will leave with a roadmap of action steps to pilot your idea and create a minimum viable product or service. You'll be led by a variety of passionate founders who have extensive experience in startup, social enterprise, and non-profit work.

The next Pilot Weekend is **January 20-22nd**.

### Details

**Meals**: You can't get much done on an empty stomach so you'll experience four family-style meals that will keep you fueled throughout the weekend (and unlimited coffee too! What?!).

**Workbook**: You'll receive a comprehensive workbook covering retreat topics and action steps for when you leave.

**Speakers**: Many speakers will present on a series of essential topics, all geared toward helping you build a viable product, service, or program.

**Community**: Good ideas become great in the context of community. You will have opportunities for intentional interaction with other participants at the weekend and in the months to come.

**Workspace**: Come work alongside other world changers! You’ll receive a three-month FREE Wayfare membership valued at $47/month (this includes a credit towards coworking or meeting rooms with additional hours available for purchase at a discounted rate).
