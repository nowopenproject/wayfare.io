## Launch Program

Launch is an hyper-local 20-week intensive program based in Orange County, California. In this program, you will explore key startup principles and insights as you directly apply them to your product, program, or service amongst a cohort of other like-minded founders. Together you will receive the practical, emotional, and spiritual support you need to propel your product, program, or service into a comprehensive business model. 

As you build your comprehensive business model, you will work on identifying and defining your mission and vision, understanding and articulating the personal “Why?” behind your product, program or service, developing your communications plans, pitching to partners, ensuring financial viability, and learning how to optimize your leadership.


**Launch includes:**

* **Two-day Intensive Kick-off**: Two full days of work sessions where we introduce you to key concepts and practical tools necessary to build a comprehensive business model. This gives you a chance to immerse yourself in what’s to come. This kickoff is our time to bond and get to know each other as a cohort!
* **Weekly dinners with startup founders** to learn from their successes and mistakes: Founders dinners are off-the-record, candid family-style dinners with entrepreneurs and founders. Each dinner will feature guest founders from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. They’ll share the good, bad, and ugly from their experiences in the startup world. The night will allow space for a Q&A with the speakers. And, since we have everyone sign nondisclosure agreements, our guest speakers can give you some of the hard truths they can’t share publicly. 
* **Weekly Tuesday Worksessions**: The morning work sessions provide you with practical knowledge and key concepts to wrestle with for your organization. These aren’t just talking heads or lectures, they’re sessions where you will put into practice what you are learning right away. Often the afternoon worksession will provide space for the emotional and spiritual support as you process through the challenges you are facing and the developing leadership skills you are gaining. 
* **Coaching/Consulting with a dedicated coach**: Coaches will support and guide you in your journey. These session are led by you, which means that all actions or consequences resulting from the coaching sessions are your responsibility. That’s a good thing, because you get to make sure your most important decisions are being guided by what you need most. 
* **Access to our advisor network**: Advising Office Hour sessions will be scheduled at various points throughout the program. Advisors will be individuals that have experience in many different aspects of starting an organization and come from diverse industries. Founders will be able to sign up for a free, 30 minute session with the advisor to ask questions or brainstorm with them. Though not required, these are highly encouraged.
* **Demo Night, Pitch Night, and other business development events**: Presentations are a hallmark of the program. You and your fellow participants will be presenting to a room full of your family members, friends, and highly connected and influential individuals. These nights are important because they help you find the resources you need to build and grow your organization. Practicing your pitches will occur regularly in the afternoon worksessions. 
* **Wayfare membership and workspace access**: As a member of our startup programs, you will have access to put what you're learning into action by working alongside a likeminded community at any of our productive, comfortable and beautiful designed workspaces. You will also receive access to free member events like our monthly learning forums!
