    I participated in Idea Weekend from a different perspective than some of the other participants. I wasn’t starting something brand new, but I had a new idea for our already existing organization. I had some specific questions regarding funding and sustainability… and as was the case with many people in the room, what I started thinking was the problem was only scratching the surface.

    Idea weekend prompted me to dive into the hard work of clarifying the root problem in order to know what the best solutions were, and the best part was that I wasn’t alone. It was so inspiring to be with 14 other people who were vulnerable enough to ask similar hard questions and ideate together with the guidance of coaches. What seemed like a hard and scary process was totally worth it in the end, brought me a lot of clarity, and made me excited to dive into what’s next!
