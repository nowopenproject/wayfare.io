  title: Founder, Creative Director, Editor-in-Chief
  company: Whilst Magazine
  text: I knew I wanted to take [Whilst](http://whilstmagazine.com) farther, to really
    dive into what the magazine stood for and how I could create a career out of this
    growing passion. I frequently found myself on the Wayfare website, and it was
    during Idea Weekend that I learned how to articulate what Whilst really is and
    how it could change lives. That’s when I knew I wanted to be a part of a community
    that exists to change the world for good and create beauty in whatever life stage
    we are journeying through. The next step, then, was to continue to press into
    what my vision was for Whilst—how far could this concept of being present in the
    midst really go? Through sitting down and talking it out with the Wayfare coaches
    and other entrepreneurs, I found my dreams were bigger than I had imagined.

    I participated in Idea Weekend from a different perspective than some of the other participants. I wasn’t starting something brand new, but I had a new idea for our already existing organization. I had some specific questions regarding funding and sustainability… and as was the case with many people in the room, what I started thinking was the problem was only scratching the surface.

    Idea weekend prompted me to dive into the hard work of clarifying the root problem in order to know what the best solutions were, and the best part was that I wasn’t alone. It was so inspiring to be with 14 other people who were vulnerable enough to ask similar hard questions and ideate together with the guidance of coaches. What seemed like a hard and scary process was totally worth it in the end, brought me a lot of clarity, and made me excited to dive into what’s next!

The top two things we hear from people who want to take action on a new idea are:

1. "I don't know where to start."
2. "I don't know the next steps to take." 

We've found it's all too common to start five steps ahead of where you should, spend countless hours googling conflicting advice, or not start at all. And that's a shame.

So we created Idea Weekend -- an intensive, hands-on community experience that equips you to take the first steps on your idea. This unique weekend gathering includes informative talks and feedback from startup guides, hands-on application of key learnings, personalized coaching, and support from others just like you. We'll guide you in developing four key statements that will serve as your roadmap as you move forward in taking action on your idea.

If you have an idea, we'd love to support you – so we're giving away a free spot! 
[Tell us about your idea](https://wayfare.io/startups/idea-weekend-contest/) for a chance to receive a free ticket to Idea Weekend, Friday May 19 – Sunday May 21st.
