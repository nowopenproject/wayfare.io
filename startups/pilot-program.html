<h2>Pilot Program</h2>
<p>Whether you have an abstract idea to make the world a better place, you've nailed that idea down and want the structure and community to begin taking meaningful action, or you want to you pilot a new product within your existing organization, we invite you to join our Pilot Program.</p>
<p>Pilot starts with an intense yet energizing 3-day conference, where you'll draft problem and solution statements, identify your purpose, learn how to test your assumptions and hypotheses, and begin building your business model. You'll leave with a roadmap for your idea to become a reality and the option to continue with 5 months of learning and progress check-ins alongside a community of other dreamers, doers, and adventurers for the common good.</p>
<p>Our unique format delivers compelling insight from startup experts AND guided application in a workshop setting.</p>
<p>The next Pilot Program starts in January 2017. Apply now!</p>
