<h2>Impact Program</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Impact groups are peer-advisory teams designed to support and challenge top missional enterprise leaders (e.g. CEOs, Executive Directors, Founders, General Managers) with the support, accountability, transformational leadership coaching, and organizational development they need to thrive, sustain their impact, and raise up new missional enterprise leaders.</p>
<h3>Who is Impact For</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Top Leaders – Founders, Executive Directors, CEOs and General Managers</strong> – leading missional enterprises who want to sustain and multiply the positive impact they are making in the world and within their organizations.</li>
  <li>Leaders who <strong>want the benefit of a primary team</strong> where they can freely explore opportunities and challenges in a non-judgmental and confidential environment, receive support, and gain insight.</li>
  <li>Leaders who want to <strong>avoid burnout</strong> that often comes with the unique pressures and challenges of a top leadership position.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Top leaders might not realize or feel like they are at risk. The facts say they are. In recent research conducted by Harvard faculty, 96% of top leaders say they are experiencing some form of burnout, and a full third of those count it as extreme – but we believe it can be prevented.</li>
  <li>The role of running an organization is unique, and it can be lonely. Nobody else will be as passionate about the organization’s mission or as burdened by the weight of big decisions, confidential information, and the lives of employees. Top leaders carry a weight that only other top leaders can relate to. Unfortunately, this is rarely recognized by leaders before burnout has already begun to negatively impact their personal and professional lives.</li>
  <li>Leaders experiencing burnout can’t sustain impact because they decreasingly perform in the same capacity they once did. Signs of burnout include difficulty focusing or making decisions, temperament changes, fatigue, scheduling changes, disappearance of healthy coping skills, and negative changes in familial and relational dynamics–all of which affect the leader and the health of the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Goal of Impact</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To provide ongoing support and tools for top leaders so they can avoid and combat burnout and lead a sustainable organization that results in multiplying impact and healthier personal and professional relationships.</li>
  <li>For leaders to have a consistent safe and neutral place to take leadership and organizational challenges and a team of people who knows one another well and can speak to and understand their experience in a way even the most supportive board members and employees cannot.</li>
  <li>As leaders experience the freedom that comes from being fully known, it positively affects their work and those they’re leading. These changes in the way they operate allow them to facilitate and create a new culture of doing business within their organization by leading with vulnerability, authenticity, and intentionality.</li>
  <li>This new culture of work creates an environment where employees within the organization are empowered and specific high potential leaders are identified as such and mentored so that they may discover their own leadership potential and carry this same culture of work and desire to advance good in the world to their own future leadership endeavors, which results in a multiplication of impact that reaches beyond the original organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Day in Impact</h3>
  <p><strong>Time commitment:</strong> Once a month, Impact cohorts gather for one full day (9 AM-4 PM) not to take a day off, but a day on… to invest in their leadership and the development of their organization – so they can sustain impact in the world and model a new culture of work within their organization. Participants also participate in a one-on-one coaching session with their Integration Guide in between group gatherings for one hour per month.</p>
  <p><strong>Format:</strong> The format of a day in Impact is very open and collaborative in order to address real personal and organizational challenges while caring and advising for others in similar leadership positions. To ensure it’s a safe and valuable space, cohort groups are limited to 6 people in order to provide intimacy, trust, and significant sharing time for each person.</p>
<h4>A day at Impact looks like this:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Leadership Exploration &amp; Development:</strong>
        <br>Participants of Impact will start the day with a personal story and leadership exercise in order to connect with their story, recognize the context they see and work out of, and understand their strengths, weaknesses, and blind spots, so they may honestly assess themselves and integrate the fullness of their lives into their work and organization for the benefit of themselves and those they lead.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Organizational Peer Advising:</strong>
        <br>Each Impact participant receives prompts before the gathering and comes prepared with 1-3 organizational challenges, questions, or issues they are facing (whether they are related to staffing, legal, financial, leadership or other). They have space to share and seek support, guidance, and advice from others in the cohort. Participants leave the session with commitments and action items for that month that become points of interaction and accountability in follow-up check-ins with the Integration Guide.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Meal sharing:</strong>
        <br>Leaders can often feel lonely even though they’re surrounded by people, and they crave connection with other high-capacity leaders that understand the unique challenges of being on top. Meal sharing in the midst of the full day of Impact allows space for leaders to enjoy camaraderie, friendship, and connection.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Guided self reflection and debrief time:</strong>
        <br>Participants spend a portion of the afternoon in solitude, engaging around a piece of wisdom, a theme, or a directional prompt, creating space for personal processing and reflection. This discipline is important because leaders often won’t allow themselves the critical space to process and reflect. The day closes with a group debrief on the experiences throughout the day, including a summary of epiphanies and commitments.
    </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Other program features</h3>
  <p><strong>Follow-up accountability &amp; coaching:</strong> Following the monthly gathering, Impact members will walk away with commitments and action items for their personal leadership and organization, along with a cohort theme for the month (i.e. “focus”) that they’re working on together and holding each other accountable to. In between monthly gatherings, Impact members will have one monthly check-in with the Integration Guide to touch base on their commitments and action items. Additionally, they will have ongoing access to an online cohort Slack channel for continual team support.</p>
  <p><strong>FLDWRK Membership and Workspace Access:</strong> Impact membership includes the "Wayfarer" workspace package, giving participants access to FLDWRK's workspaces where they can work flexibly alongside a like-minded community of difference makers, paying a discounted hourly rate with the option to upgrade their workspace package to include more hours each month. They will also have access to attend member events like our monthly learning forums and discounts on select conferences, events and workshops.</p>
  <p><strong>Formal Impact dinners with Keynote Speakers:</strong> A few times throughout the year, Impact members will gather and connect with Impact cohorts and friends over an exclusive gourmet dinner, wine and accompaniments by a private chef. Dinners will feature curated keynote speakers and discussion on topics central to the leadership and organizational content discussed in the program. Each Impact member will receive two additional tickets to each dinner – one for an employee within their organization they are mentoring and developing as a leader and the other to invite another top leader who they believe would benefit from the evening and the program.</p>
  <h4>Pricing</h4>
