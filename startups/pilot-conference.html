<h2>Pilot Conference</h2>
<p>Whether you have an abstract idea to make the world a better place, you've nailed that idea down and want the structure and community to begin taking meaningful action, or you want to pilot a new product within your existing organization, we invite you to join our Pilot Conference.</p>
<p>Pilot Conference is an energizing three days, where you'll draft problem and solution statements, identify your purpose, learn how to test your assumptions and hypotheses, and understand who your future customers are. You'll leave with a roadmap for your idea to become a reality. Youâ€™ll be in a community of other dreamers, doers, and adventurers for the common good.</p>
<p>Our unique format delivers compelling insight from startup experts AND guided application in a workshop setting.</p>
<p>The next Pilot Conference is <strong>January 20-22nd</strong>.</p>
