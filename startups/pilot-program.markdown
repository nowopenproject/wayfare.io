## Pilot Program

---

### Overview

Pilot is a **subscription based online program** designed to help you **build and test your ideas** so you can **solve a problem or issue you have observed in the world**. Pilot gives you the practical, spiritual, and emotional support you need to begin taking purposeful action on your meaningful idea, and ultimately arrive at what we call MVP (a minimum viable product, program or service).

### Who It's For

Pilot is for you if:

* **You’ve observed a problem in the world and you’re passionate about creating a solution.** You’ve got an idea that’s going to change people’s lives and make the world better... but it’s big and there are a lot of moving parts. We get it... it’s overwhelming and it can be hard to know where to start _or if you’re even working on the right things_. You’re not short on passion and drive – but you could use a guide that complements your vision. Pilot contains the practical tools you need to take small, manageable, actionable steps each day. 

* **You’ve ideated a million different paths you can take with your idea, but could use guidance and support** in breaking them down and narrowing in on the right one for you. You’re excited to define, scope, and introduce the right solution for the problem you've identified and for the people experiencing the pain.

* **You’re ready for the support of a likeminded community** to remind you that you are enough, your skills are enough, and that the world needs your idea. You could use others to lean on for feedback, ideation, and the encouragement you need to keep going tomorrow... even if today is hard.

### What Can I Expect From Pilot Program?

**Our hope is that you will arrive at MVP (minimum viable product, program, or service). This means:**

* Your idea has a well articulated purpose and objective connected to your unique story and journey. This is what makes your idea so compelling and inspiring!
* You’ve developed well articulated problem & solution statements. The problem or issue you’re addressing in the world is clear – and your solution is not only deeply rooted in your personal “why”, but it’s also a valuable and well-formed solution to the problem you’ve observed in the world that best meets the needs of the population you’re serving.
* Your solution is built with enough definition to test, iterate, and validate for scalability and repeatability. You can fearlessly envision the future of your idea & the impact it will have on the world – and have the roadmap you need to get there.
* Key customer segments have been identified and customer discovery is active. You know your audience(s) well & understand the people that will be receiving the value of your solution & idea. You’ve gotten to know them, have started customer interviews, and have learned valuable information from them to guide your idea’s development.
* Clear, defined value is being exchanged between you & your customer/audience. This means you’ve built something (yes, you!) that provides value to your audience. Your customers or audience have started to exchange their time, money or energy for the value you’ve created & are offering them.
* You have the confidence you never thought possible to actually take the plunge and do this thing, you’re equipped to fight the fear that comes with starting something new, and you’re ready to build out the foundations for a scaling organization.
* You have a supportive & encouraging community to walk and grow your idea alongside, and you know you’re not in this alone.

### Program Features

**Weekly content delivered straight to your inbox:** Each week, you’ll receive original themed program content designed to help you explore and test the various layers of your idea to help you achieve MVP. You’ll spend time exploring topics like: discovering the true root of the problem you’ve observed, solution exploration and validation (to ensure you’re bringing value to the person experiencing the problem), audience/customer segmentation and discovery, achieving financial viability, running a beta test, personal story connection, and exploring the “why” behind your idea.

**Live monthly webcasts, videos, articles & resources:** Every week, you’ll receive personal insight and guidance from startup experts on relevant topics and challenges that align with each month’s theme.

**Weekly activities & exercises:** Curated weekly exercises and worksheets will provide you with guidance to put your pen to paper and apply the insight you’ve received to your own idea. These worksheets are designed to provide you the accountability to take clear & manageable steps towards MVP in a consistent weekly rhythm.

**Virtual Community Interaction :** Starting something new is hard, and we want to make sure you’re supported every step of the way. No matter where you are physically located, throughout your participation in Pilot, you’ll walk alongside other like-minded ideators as you share your ideas, gain feedback, and receive the encouragement to carry you through via Slack -- an app that allows for easy communication between individuals and groups.
